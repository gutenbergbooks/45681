<h1>HENRIE THE SEAUENTH,<br />

<span class="ph2">sonne to Edmund earle of Richmond, which Edmund was
brother by the moothers side to Henrie the sixt.</span></h1>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 1.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Edward Plantagenet
earle of
Warwike
sonne and heire
to George duke
of Clarence
committed to
the tower.</div>

<p>King Henrie hauing thus got the victorie at Bosworth, and slaine his mortall
enimie there in the field, did send before his departure from Leicester, sir Robert
Willoughbie knight, to the manour of Sheriffehuton in the countie of Yorke, for
Edward Plantagenet earle of Warwike, sonne and heire to George duke of Clarence
then being of the age of fift&eacute;ene yeares; whome king Richard had kept there as prisoner
during the time of his vsurped reigne. Sir Robert Willoughbie receiuing the yoong
earle of the constable of that castle conueied him to London where he was shut vp in
the Tower, for doubt least some vnquiet and euill disposed persons might inuent some
occasion of new trouble by this yoong gentleman: and therefore king Henrie thought
good to haue him sure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie
commeth to
London.</div>

<p>There was beside him in the castell of Sheriffehuton the ladie Elizabeth eldest
daughter to king Edward the fourth, whome king Richard (as ye haue heard) meant
to haue married: but God otherwise ordeined for hir, and perserued hir from that
vnlawfull copulation and incestuous bed. Shortlie after, she being accompanied with
a great number as well of noblemen, as honourable matrons, was with good sp&eacute;ed
conueied to London, and brought to hir moother. In the meane season king Henrie
remooued forward by soft iournies towards London, the people comming in from all
sides to behold him, and exc&eacute;edinglie reioising at his presence, as by their voices and
gestures it well appeared.</p>

<p>At his approching n&eacute;ere to the citie, the maior and his brethren, with other worshipfull
citizens, being clothed in violet, met him at Shordich, and reuerentlie saluted him:
and so with great pompe and triumph he rode thorough the citie to the cathedrall
church of S. Paule, where he offered thr&eacute;e standards. In the one was the image of
saint George, in an other was a red fierie dragon beaten vpon white and gr&eacute;ene sarcenet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
and in the third was painted a dun cow vpon yellow tarterne. After his praiers
said, and Te deum soong, he departed to the bishops palace, and there soiourned a season.
Anon after, he assembled togither the sage councellors of the realme, in which
councell like a prince of iust faith, and true of promise, to auoid all ciuill discord, he
appointed a daie to ioine in marriage with the ladie Elizabeth, heire of the house of
Yorke; with his noble personage, heire to the line of Lancaster. Which thing not
onelie reioised the hearts of the nobles and gentlemen of the realme, but also gained
the fauours and good wils of all the commons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Henrie the
seuenth crowned
king.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1485.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement at
Westminster,
with an atteindor
and a pardon
generall.</div>

<p>After this, with great pompe he rowed vnto Westminster, &amp; there the thirtith daie of
October he was with all ceremonies accustomed, annointed, &amp; crowned king, by the
whole assent as well of the commons as of the nobilitie, &amp; called Henrie the seauenth
of that name: which was in the yeare of the world 5452, and after the birth of
our Lord 1485, in the fortie and sixt yeare of Frederike the third then emperour of
Almaine, Maximilian his sonne being newlie elected king of the Romans, in the
second yeare of Charles the eight then king of France, and in the fiue and twentith of
king Iames then ruling the realme of Scotland. For the establishing of all things
as well touching the preseruation of his owne estate, as the commendable administration
of iustice and preferrement of the common wealth of his realme, he called his
high court of parlement at Westminster the seauenth daie of Nouember, wherein was
atteinted Richard late duke of Glocester, calling and naming himselfe by vsurpation,
king Richard the third.</p>

<p>Likewise there was atteinted as ch&eacute;efe aiders and assistants to him in the battell at
Bosworth, aduanced against the present king, Iohn late duke of Norffolke, Thomas
earle of Surrie, Francis Louell knight vicount Louell, Walter Deuereux knight late
lord Ferrers, Iohn lord Zouch, Robert Harrington, Richard Charleton, Richard Ratcliffe,
William Berkeleie of Weleie, Robert Middleton, Iames Harrington, Robert
Brakenberie, Thomas Pilkington, Walter Hopton, William Catesbie, Roger Wake,
William Sapcote of the countie of Huntington, Humfrie Stafford, William Clerke
of Wenlocke, Geffrie saint Germaine, Richard Watkins herald of armes, Richard Reuell
of Derbishire, Thomas Pulter of the countie of Kent, Iohn Welsh otherwise called
Hastings, Iohn Kendall late secretaire to the said Richard late duke of Glocester,
Iohn Bucke, Andrew Rat, and William Brampton of Burford.</p>

<p>In which atteindor neuerthelesse there were diuerse clauses and prouisos for the
benefit of their wiues and other persons, that had or might claime anie right, title,
or interest lawfullie vnto anie castels, manours, lordships, townes, towneships, honours,
lands, tenements, rents, seruices, f&eacute;e farmes, annuities, knights f&eacute;es, aduousons,
reuersions, remainders, and other hereditaments; whereof the said persons atteinted
were possessed or seized to the vses of such other persons: with a speciall prouiso
also, that the said atteindor should not be preiudiciall to Iohn Catesbie knight,
Thomas Reuell, and William Ashbie esquiers, in, of, &amp; vpon the manour of Kirkebie
vpon Wretheke in the countie of Leicester, nor in, of, and vpon anie other lands and
tenements in Kirkebie aforesaid, Melton, Somerbie, Thropseghfield, and Godebie, which
they had of the gift &amp; feoffement of Thomas Dauers, &amp; Iohn Lie. And further, notwithstanding
this atteindor, diuerse of the said persons afterwards were not onelie by
the king pardoned, but also restored to their lands and liuings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king aduanceth
his
fr&eacute;ends.</div>

<p>Moreouer, in this present parlement, he caused proclamation to be made, that all
men were pardoned and acquited of their offenses, which would submit themselues
to his mercie, and receiue an oth to be true and faithfull vnto him: wherevpon manie
that came out of sanctuaries and other places were receiued to grace, and admitted
for his subiects. After this, he began to remember his speciall fr&eacute;ends, of whome
some he aduanced to honour and dignitie, and some he inriched with goods and possessions,
euerie man according to his deserts and merits. And to begin, his vncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
Iasper earle of Penbroke, he created duke of Bedford; Thomas lord Stanleie was
created earle of Derbie; and the lord Chendew of Britaine his especiall fr&eacute;end, he
made earle of Bath; sir Giles Daubeneie was made lord Daubeneie; sir Robert Willoughbie
was made lord Brooke. And Edward Stafford eldest sonne to Henrie late
duke of Buckingham, he restored to his name, dignitie, &amp; possessions, which by
king Richard were confiscat and atteinted. Beside this, in this parlement was this
notable act assented to and concluded as followeth; to the pleasure of almightie God,
wealth, prosperitie, and suertie of this realme of England, and to the singular comfort
of all the kings subiects of the same, in auoiding all ambiguities and questions.</p>


<h2>An act for the establishing of the crowne in the line of Henrie the seauenth.</h2>

<p>Be it ordeined, established, and enacted by this present parlement, that the inheritance
of the crown of this realme of England, &amp; also of France, with all the preheminence,
and dignitie roiall to the same apperteining, all other seigniories to the
king belonging beyond the sea, with the appurtenances thereto in anie wise due or
apperteining, shall rest, remaine, and abide, in the most roiall person of our now souereigne
lord king Henrie the seuenth, and in the heires of his bodie lawfullie comming,
perpetuallie, with the grace of God so to indure, and in none other.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">The king red&eacute;emeth
his hostages.</div>

<p>Beside this act, all atteindors of this king enacted by king Edward and king
Richard were adnihilated, and the record of the same iudged to be defaced; and all
persons atteinted for his cause and occasion were restored to their goods, lands, and
possessions. Diuerse acts also made in the time of king Edward and king Richard
were reuoked, and other adiudged more expedient for the common wealth were put in
their places and concluded. After the dissolution of this parlement, the king remembring
his fr&eacute;ends left in hostage beyond the seas, that is to wit, the marquesse Dorset,
sir Iohn Bourchier, he with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed red&eacute;emed them, and sent also into
Flanders for Iohn Morton bishop of Elie. These acts performed, he chose to be of
his councell a conuenient number of right graue and wise councellors.</p>

<p>&para; This did he, that he might the more roiallie gouerne his kingdome, which he obteined
and inioied as a thing by God elected and prouided, and by his especiall fauour
and gratious aspect compassed and atchiued. Insomuch that men commonlie report
that seauen hundred nintie &amp; seauen y&eacute;eres passed, it was by a heauenlie voice reuealed
to Cadwalader last of king Britains, that his stocke &amp; progenie should reigne in this
land &amp; beare dominion againe. Wherevpon most men were persuaded in their owne
opinion, that by this heauenlie voice he was prouided &amp; ordeined long before to inioy
&amp; obteine this kingdome. Which thing K. Henrie the sixt did also shew before, as it
were by propheticall inspiration, at such time as the earle of Penbroke presented the
said Henrie (at that time a proper child) vnto Henrie the sixt, whome after he had beheld,
and a good while viewed the comlinesse of his countenance, and orderlie lineaments
of his bodie, he said to such p&eacute;eres as stood about him: Lo, suerlie this is he,
to whome both we and our aduersaries, leauing the possession of all things, shall
hereafter giue roome and place: &amp; so it came to passe by the appointment of God, to
whose gouernement, gift, and disposing, all realmes and all dominions are subiect, as
king Dauid confesseth, saieng:</p>

Elizabeth, daughter to king Edward. Which like a good prince, according to his oth,
&amp; promise, he did both solemnize &amp; consummate shortlie after, that is to saie, on the
eight&eacute;enth daie of Ianuarie. By reason of which marriage, peace was thought to descend
out of heauen into England, considering that the lines of Lancaster and Yorke
were now brought into one knot, and connexed togither, of whose two bodies one
heire might succ&eacute;ed to rule and inioie the whole monarchie and realme of England,
which before was rent and diuided into factions &amp; partakings, whereby manie a mans
life was lost, great spoiles made of peoples goods, wast of wealth, worship, and honor,
all which ended in this blessed and gratious connexion, authorised by God, as
our Anglorum pr&aelig;lia saith:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hoc Deus omnipotens pacis confecerat author,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ciuil&iacute;sque habuit tandem contentio finem.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Yeomen of the
gard first brought
in.</div>

<p>Shortlie after, for the better preseruation of his roiall person, he constituted and
ordeined a certeine number, as well of archers, as of diuerse other persons, hardie,
strong, and actiue to giue dailie attendance on his person, whom he named yeomen
of his gard, which president men thought that he learned of the French king when
he was in France. For it is not remembered, that anie king of England before that
daie vsed anie such furniture of dailie souldiers. &para; In this same y&eacute;ere a new kind of
sickenes inuaded suddenlie the people of this land, passing through the same from the
one end to the other. It began about the one and twentith of September, and continued
vntill the latter end of October, being so sharpe and deadlie, that the like was
neuer heard of to anie mans remembrance before that time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sweating
sickenesse.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A remedie for
the sweating
sickenesse.</div>

<p>For suddenlie a deadlie burning sweat so assailed their bodies and distempered their
bloud with a most ardent heat, that scarse one amongst an hundred that sickened did
escape with life: for all in maner as soone as the sweat tooke them, or within a short
time after y&eacute;elded the ghost. Beside the great number which deceassed within the
citie of London, two maiors successiuelie died within eight daies and six Aldermen.
At length, by the diligent obseruation of those that escaped (which marking what
things had doone them good, and holpen to their deliuerance, vsed the like againe.)
When they fell into the same disease, the second or third time, as to diuerse it chanced,
a remedie was found for that mortall maladie, which was this. If a man on the day
time were taken with the sweat, then should he streight lie downe with all his clothes
and garments, and continue in his sweat foure and twentie houres, after so moderate a
sort as might be.</p>

<p>If in the night he chanced to be taken, then should he not rise out of his bed for
the space of foure and twentie houres, so casting the clothes that he might in no wise
prouoke the sweat, but lie so temperatlie, that the water might distill out softlie of
the owne accord, and to absteine from all meat if he might so long suffer hunger, and
to take no more drinke neither hot nor cold, than, would moderatelie quench and
asswage his thirstie appetite. Thus with lukewarme drinke, temperate heate, and
measurable cloaths manie escaped: few which vsed this order (after it was found out)
died of that sweat. Marie one point diligentlie aboue all other in this cure is to be
obserued, that he neuer did put his hand or f&eacute;et out of the bed to refresh or coole himselfe,
which to doo is no lesse ieopardie than short and present death. Thus this disease
comming in the first yeare of king Henries reigne, was iudged (of some) to be a
token and signe of a troublous reigne of the same king, as the proofe partlie afterwards
shewed it selfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king requested

vnto the lord maior of London, requiring of the citie a prest of six thousand marks.

a prest of two thousand pounds, which was levied of the companies, and not of
the wards; and in the yeare next insuing, it was well and trulie againe repaid euerie
penie, to the good contentation and satisfieng of them that disbursed it. The king
considering that the suertie of his roiall estate and defense of the realme consisted
ch&eacute;efelie in good lawes and ordinances to be had and obserued among his people summoned
eftsoones his high court of parlement, therein to deuise and establish some profitable
acts and statutes, for the wealth and commoditie of his people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king goeth
into the North.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A rebellion
made by the

others.</div>

<p>After this, hauing set things in quiet about London, he tooke his iournie into the
North parts, there to purge all the dregs of malicious treson that might rest in the
hearts of vnquiet persons, and namelie in Yorkeshire, where the people bare more
fauour vnto king Richard in his life time, than those of anie other part of the realme
had commonlie doone. He kept the feast of Easter at Lincolne; where he was certified
that the lord Louell and Humfrie Stafford, and Thomas Stafford, his brother,
were departed out of the sanctuarie at Colchester, to what place or whither, no man as
yet could tell. The king little regarding the matter, kept on his iournie, and came to
Yorke, where as soone as he was once setled, it was openlie shewed and declared for a
truth to the king himselfe, that Frances lord Louell was at hand with a strong and
mightie power of men, and would with all diligence inuade the citie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Humfrie Stafford.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Stafford.</div>

<p>It was also told him, that the forenamed Staffords were in Worsetershire, and had
raised a great band of the countrie people and commons there, and had cast lots what
part should assault the gates, what men should scale the wals of the citie of Worcester,
and who should let the passages for letting of rescues and aiders. The king
could not bel&eacute;eue this report to be true at the first, but after that, by letters of credence
sent from his fr&eacute;ends, he was fullie persuaded that it was too true, he was put
in no small feare, and not without great cause. For he wiselie considered, that he
neither had anie competent armie readie, nor conuenient furniture to arme them that
were present: and also he was in such place, where he could not assemble anie power,
but of those whome he sore mistrusted, as fr&eacute;ends to them that were most his enimies;
the memorie of king Richard as yet being not amongst them forgotten nor
worne out of mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of

<p>But bicause the matter required quicke expedition, he appointed the duke of Bedford
with thr&eacute;e thousand men not altogither the best armed (for their brest plates for
the most part were of tanned leather) to march foorth against the lord Louell, and
to set vpon him without anie lingering of time. The duke hasting forward, approched
to the campe of his enimies, &amp; before he would assaile them, he caused the heralds
to make proclamation, that all those that would depart from their armour, and submit
themselues as subiects vnto their naturall prince and souereigne lord, should be
pardoned of all former offenses. The lord Louell vpon this proclamation, either putting
mistrust in his souldiers, or fearing himselfe in his owne behalfe, fled priuilie
in a night from his companie, and left them as a flocke of sh&eacute;epe without a sh&eacute;epeheard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Louell

<p>Which departure of the lord when his armie vnderstood, it put the souldiers in such
despaire of atchiuing anie further enterprise, that they immediatlie put off their armour,
and came directlie vnto the duke, euerie man humblie submitting himselfe,
and desiring pardon of his offenses. So in this wise was that dangerous storme and
cruell rage of those furious rebels appeased, which was doubted would haue growne
to the destruction of manie a man. The lord Louell the procurer of this businesse,
escaping awaie got him into Lancashire, and there for a certeine space lay lurking in
secret with sir Thomas Broughton knight, which in those parties was a man of no
small authoritie and power.</p>

that sanctuarie was not a sufficient defense (as was prooued before the iustices of the

<p>Amongst other such monsters and limmes of the diuell, there was one sir Richard
Simond pr&eacute;est, a man of base birth, and yet well learned, but not so learned as wilie,
nor so wilie as vngratious, delighting in fraud &amp; deceit, euen from his youth. He had a
scholer called Lambert Simenell, one of a gentle nature and pregnant wit, to be the
organe and ch&eacute;efe instrument, by the which he might conueie and bring to passe his
misch&eacute;euous attempt. The diuell ch&eacute;efe master of such practises, put in the venemous
braine of this disloiall and traitorous pr&eacute;est to deuise how he might make his scholer
the foresaid Lambert to be reputed as right inheritour to the crowne of this realme:
namelie, for that the fame went that king Edwards children were not dead but fled
secretlie into some strange place, and there to be liuing: and that Edward earle of
Warwike, sonne and heire to the duke of Clarence, either was, or shortlie should be
put to death.</p>

<p>These rumors though they s&eacute;emed not to be grounded of anie likelihood to the wiser
sort of men, yet incouraged this p&eacute;euish priest to thinke the time come, that his
scholer Lambert might take vpon him the person and name of one of king Edwards
children. And herevpon at Oxford, where their abiding was, the said pr&eacute;est instructed
his pupill both with princelie behauiour, ciuill maners, and good literature, declaring
to him of what linage he should affirme himselfe to be descended, and omitted nothing
that might serue for his purpose. Soone after, the rumor was blowne abroad,
that the earle of Warwike was broken out of prison. And when the pr&eacute;est sir Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>

was altogether affectionate and parciall in hir behalfe; besides that it was reasonable in

she did, neither stood it with the frailtie of a woman to withstand the temptations

Edward the yoong earle of Warwike should be brought from the Tower through the

he went openlie in procession, that euerie man might s&eacute;e him, hauing communication

auailed euill disposed persons. For the earle of Lincolne sonne to Iohn de la Poole

to neglect and omit so readie an occasion of new trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An ill matter

<p>Wherefore they determined to vphold the enterprise of the Irishmen, and other

the ladie Margaret duchesse of Burgognie, trusting by hir helpe to make a puissant

the dissolution of the parlement which then was holden, he fled secretlie into Flanders

Henrie supposing that no man would haue b&eacute;ene so mad as to haue attempted anie

how to subdue the seditious conspiracie of the Irishmen. But hearing that the earle

caused yoong Lambert to be proclaimed and named king of England, after the most
solemne fashion, as though he were the verie heire of the bloud roiall lineallie borne

and vnarmed, sauing skains and mantels, of whome the lord Thomas Gerardine was
capteine and conductor, they sailed into England with this new found king, and landed
for a purpose at the pile of Fowdreie, within a little of Lancaster, trusting there to
find aid by the meanes of sir Thomas Broughton, one of the ch&eacute;efe companions of
the conspiracie.</p>

<p>The king had knowledge of the enimies intent before their arriuall, and therefore
hauing assembled a great armie (ouer the which the duke of Bedford, and the earle of
Oxenford were ch&eacute;efe capteins) he went to Couentrie, where he was aduertised, that
the earle of Lincolne was landed at Lancaster with his new king. H&eacute;ere he tooke
aduise of his councellors what was best to be doone, whether to set on the enimies
without further delaie, or to protract time a while. But at length it was thought best
to delaie no time but to giue them battell, before they should increase their power, and
therevpon he remooued to Notingham, &amp; there by a little wood called Bowres, he
pitched his field.</p>

expert men of warre, namelie of the countries n&eacute;ere adioining; so that the kings

<p>But before he came there, king Henrie knowing all his enimies purposes, came the

miles further, and pitching his field, lodged there that night. The earle of Lincolne
certified of his comming, was nothing abashed, but kept still on his iournie; and at a little
village called Stoke, nigh to the king and his armie, set downe his campe. The next
daie the king diuided his whole power into thr&eacute;e battels, and after in good arraie approched
nigh to the towne of Stoke. The earle likewise set foorth his armie, and
incountring with the kings people in a faire plaine there, m&eacute;et for the triall of such a

<p>Then both the armies ioined and fought verie earnestlie, in so much that the Almains,

equals and matches to the Englishmen. But as for Martine Sward their colonell, few
of the Englishmen, either in valiant courage, or strength, and nimblenesse of bodie was
to him comparable. On the other side, the Irishmen, although they fought manfullie,
and stucke to it valiantlie; yet bicause they were (after the maner of their countrie)
almost naked, without anie conuenable furniture of armour, they were striken downe
and slaine like dull &amp; brute beasts, which was a great discouragement to the residue of

no man could well iudge to whome the victorie was like to incline.</p>

were either apprehended as prisoners in their running awaie, or else slaine and brought

there were not halfe of them which fought in the fore-ward, and gaue the onset slaine

of the duke of Clarence, and his maister sir Richard Simond priest both taken, but
neither of them put to death; bicause that Lambert was but an innocent, and of

Iulian S. Petri ad Vincula: but the chiefest thing that accomplished his election, was,
that with a new example for that time, he bought by the consent and knowledge of
euerie one, partlie for monie, and partlie with promises of offices and great dignities,
manie voices of the cardinals, who reiecting the instruction of the gospell, were not
ashamed to passe to him by sale, an authoritie and power to make merchandize of the
holie tresures, &amp; that with the name of the celestiall authoritie in the most high part
of the temple.</p>

<p>To which abhominable &amp; too prophane negotiation manie of them were induced
by the cardinall Ascanius, but that was not more with persuasions and sutes, than
with his example: for that being corrupted with the infinit desire of riches, he made the
pope promise him for his hire and recompense of so great wickednesse, the office of
vicechancellorship (the principallest place in the court of Rome) togither with benefices,
castels, and his palace of Rome full of mooueables of great valour. But the
pope for all this could not auoid; neither for the time to come, the iudgment and
iuistice of God; nor for the present, the infamie and iust hate of men, in whom for this
election was no small impressions of astonishment and horror, not onelie for that it
was intangled with meanes dishonest, but also bicause the natures and conditions of

Ferdinand king of Naples, dissembling openlie the griefe he had of that election,
signified to the qu&eacute;ene his wife with teares (which he was woont to forbeare euen in
the death of his children) that there was created a pope who wold be most hurtfull to
Italie, and the whole common weale of Christendome. A iudgement not vnworthie
of the wisedome of such a prince: for that in Alexander the sixt (for so would this
new pope be called) was a subtiltie, sharpenesse, and expedition of wit most singular,
a counsell excellent, a woonderfull efficacie in persuasion, and in all great affaires a
iudgement and care incredible. But these vertues were maruellouslie defaced by his
vices, for touching his maners and customes, they were verie dishonest, in his administrations
he expressed little sinceritie, in his countenance no shame, in his words
small truth, in his heart little faith, and in his opinion lesse religion. Of the contrarie
all his actions were defiled with an insatiable couetousnesse, and immoderate ambition,
a barbarous crueltie, and a burning desire to raise and make great (by what meanes
soeuer) his children, who were manie in number; and amongst others, one no lesse
detestable than the father, to whose cursed counsels he became a wicked instrument.
Thus much (by waie of digression) of Alexander, a pope (as you heare) well qualified,
and therefore forward enough to creat cardinals both in England and elsewhere of like
disposition. But to returne to the storie.</p>

be made in rendering thanks to God for his fortunate victorie. Then caused he execution
to be done, of such rebels &amp; traitors as were taken in the field, either at the
battell, or in the chase. And shortlie after he went into Yorkeshire, &amp; there coasted
the countrie ouerthwart, searching out such as had aided his enimies and were thought
to be seditious persons, whome he punished, some by imprisonment, some by fines,
and some by death: according to the qualitie of their offenses, and as was thought
most expedient [not by extremitie of rigor inclining to tyrannie, but by due moderation
of iustice tempering execution with clemencie; according to the good rule of

<p>K. Henrie after the returne of his ambassadors out of Scotland, came from Newcastell

came to him ambassadors from Charles the French king, which declared both the
recouerie of certeine townes out of the hands of Maximilian king of Romans, which
he had wrongfullie deteined from the crowne of France before that time; and also
that their maister king Charles had now wars in hand against Francis duke of Britaine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
bicause that he succoured and mainteined diuers noble men, as the duke of Orleance
and others, that were rebels and traitors, against him and the realme of France.
Wherefore his request was, that for the old familiaritie that had bene betwixt them,
he would either assist and helpe him, or else stand neuter betwixt them, neither helping
nor yet hurting the one nor the other.</p>

<p>Vpon good and deliberate aduise taken in this matter, bicause it was iudged weightie,
the king for answer told the French ambassadors, that he would neither spare
paine nor cost, to set some reasonable staie betwixt their souereigne lord king Charles,
and the duke of Britaine: so that a finall end and some perfect conclusion of friendship
might be had betwixt them. And so as soone as the French ambassadors were
returned home, the king sent his chapleine Christopher Urswike ouer into France to
king Charles, as well to shew that he was glad of the victorie which he had against

inforced his whole puissance to subdue them, and besieged the citie of Nants. And on

so that euerie man should thinke that he was fled the realme, without knowledge of

in the which it was not onelie determined that the duke of Britaine should be
aided with a power of men against the wrongfull inuasions of the Frenchmen, but
also there were diuerse summes of monie granted to the furnishing foorth and maintenance

to make the Frenchmen bel&eacute;eue that they had a great number of Englishmen, although
they had but foure hundred onelie with the lord Wooduile. The victorie in
this battell fell to the Frenchmen, so that almost all the Englishmen were slaine with
the lord Wooduile, beside six thousand Britons. The duke of Orleance and the
prince of Orainge were taken prisoners, which were there on the Britons part. The

commanded all men to send their horsses and wagons backe, but the lord Morleie said
he would ride till he came to hand strokes. Thus they marched foorth till they came
to a low banke, and no d&eacute;epe ditch, where the ordinance laie; and there the archers
shot altogither, euerie man an arrow, and so fell prostrate to the ground. The enimies
herewith discharged their ordinance, and ouershot them.</p>

<p>The Almains lept ouer the ditch with their morice pikes. The Englishmen in the

and tooke manie prisoners. The other Englishmen hasted by the causie to enter
in at the north gate of the campe, where the lord Morleie being on horssebacke in a
rich coate, was slaine with a gun. When his death was knowen, euerie man killed
his prisoner, and slue all such as did withstand them, to the number of eight thousand
men; in so much that of two thousand that came out of Bruges (as the Flemish
chronicle reporteth) there came not home one hundred. On the English part was
slaine the lord Morleie, and not an hundred more.</p>

<p>The Englishmen tooke their ordinance and sent it to Newport, with all the spoile

they made thitherward: but the Frenchmen fled, and so they burned part of the
towne, and came againe to Newport, where the lord Daubeneie left all the Englishmen
that were hurt and returned to Calis, where he buried the bodie of the lord Morleie.
The Englishmen got great riches at this field, for they that went foorth in
cloth, came home in silke, and those that went out on foot, came home on great
horsses. The lord Cordes being at Ipre with twentie thousand men, was sore displeased
with this ouerthrow; &amp; therefore thinking to be reuenged, besieged the
towne of Newport right stronglie, and shot dailie at the wals, breaking them in
manie places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English archers.</div>

<p>But the Englishmen that were hurt at Dixmew field before, and might either stand
or draw bowe, neuer came from the wals. On a daie the Frenchmen gaue a great
assault to a tower, and perforce entered it, and set vp the banner of the lord Cordes.
But s&eacute;e the chance! During the time of the assault, there arriued a barke with foure
score fresh, English archers, which came streight to the tower, and did so much, that
what with the helpe of such as before were wounded and hurtmen, and of the couragious
harts of the new come archers incouraged greatlie by the women of the towne,
crieng; Shoot Englishmen, shoot: the tower was regained out of the Frenchmens
hands, and the banner of the lord Cordes rent in p&eacute;eces, and in place thereof the
penon of saint George set vp. Then the Frenchmen, supposing a great aid of Englishmen
to haue b&eacute;ene come to the towne by sea, left the assault.</p>

<p>In the sixt yeare of king Henries reigne there came ambassadors to him from the
French king the lord Francis of Lutzenburgh, Charles Marignane, and Robert
Gaguine minister of the Bonnehommes of the trinitie. The effect of their comming was
to haue concluded a peace with king Henrie, and that with good will the French king
might dispose of the mariage of the yoong duchesse of Britaine, as he should thinke
good; and to make void the contract and former mariage, which by proxie the deputie
of Maximilian king of Romans had before time contracted &amp; made with hir. But
thereto would not king Henrie gaue his consent, euer harping on this string, that the
maiden being once lawfullie combined in matrimonie with Maximilian, ought not to
be compelled against hir will and promise (yea and contrarie to all law, right and
equitie) to take anie other person than him to hir spouse and husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Henrie is

<p>In d&eacute;ed king Henrie was loth that the French king should marrie the duchesse of

to the crowne of France: and therefore he did what he could to hinder that
bargaine. Yet at length it was agr&eacute;ed that a forme of a league should be drawen
with conditions, clauses, and couenants. And for full concluding of the same, it was
thought expedient, that the king of England should send ambassadors to the French
king to finish all matters betwixt them. Wherevpon the French ambassadors being
dismissed with great rewards, streightwaies Thomas erle of Ormond, and Thomas Goldenston
prior of Christes church in Canturburie, were appointed by the king to follow
them into France, instructed fullie in althings that he would haue on his behalfe either

he had in charge to conclude a peace and vnitie betwixt the French king and the king
of England. He moouing this matter to the French king, found him nothing strange
to incline to his motion. Wherevpon the bishop of Concordia conceiuing good hope,
and therewith desirous (as became him best bearing that title) to set an attonement
betwixt those two kings, tooke his iournie towards England, to the intent he might
mooue king Henrie to be agr&eacute;eable therevnto, and so comming to Calis, found the
English ambassadors there, being so farre on their waie towards the French king; and
being honorablie receiued of them into that towne, after they had communed togither,
the bishop tooke the sea, and was transported ouer into England, and the ambassadors
departed towards the French king.</p>

<p>After the bishop of Concordia had talked with king Henrie, and perceiued that

the Frenchmen so handled the matter, that whilest they outwardlie shewed how they
desired nothing but fr&eacute;endship and amitie, they allured the yoong dutchesse of Britaine
to submit hirselfe wholie to their discretion, so that shortlie after she was maried
to king Charles. Now the English ambassadors, after they perceiued which waie the

h&eacute;e was iustlie prouoked to make warre against the Frenchmen: and therefore desired
them of their beneuolent aid of men and monie toward the maintenance therof.
The cause was so iust, that euerie man allowed it; and to the setting foorth of the
war taken in hand for so necessarie an occasion, euerie man promised his helping
hand. The king commended them for their true and faithfull hearts. And to the intent
that he might spare the poorer sort of the commons (whome he euer desired to
k&eacute;epe in fauor) he thought good first to exact monie of the richest sort by waie of a

appeareth before in his historie. King Henrie following the like example, published
abroad, that by their open gifts he would measure and search their beneuolent hearts
and good minds toward him; so that he that gaue most, should be iudged to be his
most louing fr&eacute;end; and he that gaue little, to be est&eacute;emed according to his gift. By
this it appeareth, that whatsoeuer is practised for the princes profit, and brought to a
president by matter of record, maie be turned to the great preiudice of the people,
if rulers in authoritie will so adiudge and determine it. But by this means king Henrie
got innumerable great summes of monie, with some grudge of the people, for the
extremitie shewed by the commissioners in diuers places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Albert the duke

policie to get

Dam.</div>

<p>Ye haue heard before, how the lord of Rauenstein, by the aid of Bruges &amp; Gant,
had taken the towne and two castels of Sluis, which he kept against his souereigne
lord Maximilian, and getting into the hauen certeine ships and barks, robbed, spoiled,
&amp; tooke prisoners the ships and vessels of all nations that passed alongest by that coast,
towards the mart at Antwerpe, or into anie part of Brabant, Zeland, or Friseland, and
was euer sufficientlie vittelled out of France and Picardie. There was a little towne
also two miles from Bruges towards the sea, called Dam, which was a bulworke to
Bruges, and an hedspring to Sluis. The king of Romans had attempted the wining of
this towne diuerse times, but missed his purpose; till at length Albert duke of Saxonie,
a great fr&eacute;end to the king of Romans, by policie found meanes to get it.</p>

<p>This duke feining himselfe as a neuter betwixt the king of Romans, and the rebels
of Flanders, required of the lords of Bruges, that he might enter peaceablie into their
towne according to his estate, with a certeine number of men of armes, to communicate
with them diuerse matters of great weight, and sent before his cariages and herbengers
to make prouision. They of Bruges were in no doubt of him, so that his men
of warre entered into the citie in good order, and he followed. They that went before,
inquired for innes and lodgings, as though they would haue rested there all the night,
and so went foorth still in order asking after lodgings, till they came at the gate that
leadeth directlie toward Dam, distant from Bruges a Flemish mile, which is called the
bulworke of Bruges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of

<p>The capteins and inhabitants of Dam suspecting no harme to come out of Bruges,
thought their fr&eacute;ends (knowing some danger towards) had sent them aid, and so nothing
mistrusting those that approched their towne, suffered them to enter, and so was the
towne of Dam taken by sleight, which could not be woone by open force. This
chance sore displeased them of Bruges, for now could they haue no recourse to the
sea; so that they must n&eacute;eds fall into ruine and decaie. The duke of Saxonie thus
hauing woone the towne of Dam, sent to the king of England, that if it would please
him to minister anie aid by sea, h&eacute;e would besiege Sluis by land. Wherevpon the
king of England, vpon due consideration of the dukes motion (as he was wise enough
in all his enterprises, and no lesse fortunate in the issue of the same) would conclude
nothing vpon the sudden, but (as he did alwaies) ruled his affaires by good counsell,

Edward Poinings a right valiant knight and hardie capteine, with twelue ships well
furnished with bold souldiers and sufficient artillerie. Which sir Edward sailed into

assaulted the lesse castell, and issued out of their ships at the ebbe, neuer suffering

passe from the one to the other; which bridge one night the Englishmen did set on
fire. Then he, perceiuing that he must lose his castels by force, and that the Flemings
could not aid him, y&eacute;elded the castels to sir Edward Poinings, and the towne to the
duke of Saxonie, vpon certeine conditions. Sir Edward Poinings kept the castels a

trumperie: yet should it not offend the reader, considering that a people estranged
from the true knowledge of God and sincere religion put the same in practise, as supposing
principall holinesse to consist in that blind deuotion.</p>

<p>On the sixt of Aprill (saith he) this y&eacute;ere, the king commanded all the nobilitie of
his realme to assemble at the cathedrall church of S. Paule in London, where (after
Te Deum solemnlie soong) the cardinall of Canturburie, standing on the steps before

manie yeares had b&eacute;ene possessed of the Moores or Mauritane nation, being infidels &amp;
vnchristened people, was now of late besieged a great time by Don Ferdinando and
Elizabeth his wife, king and qu&eacute;ene of Spaine, Arragon, and Castile. And the said
infidels, by reason of siege brought to great penurie and miserie, for lacke of vittels &amp;
necessarie viands, perceiuing that all succours were clerelie stopped and excluded from
them, and so brought into vtter despaire of aid, or comfort, after long consultation had
amongst them, determined to render themselues and their citie to the said king vpon
diuerse couenants and conditions, and therevpon sent to him diuerse senators of the
citie fullie instructed of their mind and purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The citie of Granado

accompanied with fiue hundred horsmen, and thr&eacute;e thousand footmen toward the citie.
And as he approched n&eacute;ere to the suburbs, there issued out diuers noble and valiant

they prostrated and humbled themselues before the said great master, and with dolorous

<p>When he had the keies, and was also possessed of that strong and magnificent

Melchita; which done and finished, he tooke possession of all the fortresses, towers,

he caused to be erected and set vp on the highest tower of the palace (where it might
best be s&eacute;ene) the signe and token of the crosse, whereon Christ for vs sinners
suffered his bitter passion. At the raising whereof were present an archbishop

<p>&para; In the moneth of Maie next and immediatlie following this triumph, was holden
a great and valiant iusting within the kings palace of Shine, now named Richmond,
the which indured by the space of a moneth, sometime within the said palace
and sometime without, vpon the gr&eacute;ene before the gate of the said palace. In which
iustes sir Iames Parker knight, running against a gentleman named Hugh Vauhan, by
casualtie was so sore hurt and brused, that he died thereof. This yeare also two

pardons, wherewith they had deceiued the people, &amp; got much monie. And for that
one of them had feined himselfe to be a priest, h&eacute;e was sent to Newgate, where he

France, beginning at the creation of the world, and ending in the third yeare of the
reigne of king Henrie the eight, which booke is now imprinted to the end of Richard
the third.</p>

<p>Maximilian king of Romans, intending to be reuenged on the Frenchmen for the
manie iniuries doone to him of late (and especiallie for that king Charles had forsaken
his daughter ladie Margaret, and purposed to take to wife the ladie Anne of
Britaine) bicause he was not rich enough to mainteine the warre of himselfe, he sent
his ambassadour, one Iames Contibald, a man of great wisedome, to require the king
of England to take his part against the French king, making diuers great offers on
his owne behalfe, if it should please him so to doo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie and Maximilian agr&eacute;e to plague the Frenchmen.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 7.</div>

<p>King Henrie no lesse desirous than Maximilian to put the French king to trouble,
and chieflie to aid the Britains in the extremitie of their businesse, gladlie consented
to the request of Maximilian; and promised to prepare an armie with all sp&eacute;ed, and
in time conuenient to passe the seas with the same, and inuade the French territories.
In this verie season, Charles the French king receiued the ladie Anne of Britaine, as his
pupill into his hands, and with great solemnitie hir espoused, hauing with hir in dower,
the whole duchie of Britaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cause of Maximilians malice against Charles of France.</div>

<p>Now was Maximilian in great chafe toward the French king, not onelie for that he had
refused his daughter, but also had ber&eacute;eued him of his assured wife the said ladie
Anne, contrarie to all right and conscience. Wherefore he sent vnto king Henrie,
desiring him with all sp&eacute;ed to passe the seas with his armie, that they might pursue
the warre against their aduersarie, with fire, sword and bloud. King Henrie hearing
this, and hauing no mistrust in the promise of Maximilian, with all sp&eacute;ed leuied an
armie, and rigged his nauie of ships. And when all things were readie he sent his almoner
Christopher Urswike, and sir Iohn Riselie knight vnto Maximilian, to certifie
him, that the king was in a readinesse, and would arriue at Calis, as soone as he
should be aduertised that Maximilian and his men were readie to ioine with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maximilian dealeth dishonestlie with the king of England to his great vexation.</div>

<p>These ambassadors comming into Flanders perceiued that Maximilian was neither
purueied of men, monie, nor armor, nor of any other thing neccessarie for the setting
foorth of warre; sauing onlie that his will was good, although his power was small.
King Henrie being aduertised hereof by letters sent to him from his said ambassadors,
was sore disquieted in his mind, and was almost brought to his wits end, to consider
how his companions in arms should thus faile him at n&eacute;ed; but taking aduise of his
counsell, at length he determined not to stay his prepensed iournie, and therfore he so
increased his numbers before he tooke ship, that he with his owne power might be
able to match with his aduersaries. When he had thus gathered and assembled his
armie, h&eacute;e sailed to Calis the sixt day of October, and there incamped himselfe for
a space, to s&eacute;e all his men and prouision in such readinesse, as nothing should be wanting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maximilian king of Romans breaketh promise with king Henrie in ioining with him to inuade France.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The dissimulation of the French king.</div>

<p>In this place all the armie had knowledge by the ambassadours (which were newlie
returned out of Flanders) that Maximilian could not set foorth anie armie, for lacke
of monie: and therefore there was no succour to be looked for at his hand. But the
Englishmen were nothing dismaid therewith, as they that iudged themselues able
enough to match the Frenchmen without the helpe of anie other nation. In the meane
season, although the French king had an armie togither, both for number and furniture
able to trie in battell with the Englishmen: yet he made semblance as though he
desired nothing more than peace, as the thing much more profitable to him than warre:
the minds of the Britains were not wholie setled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A motion on the
French part for a
treatie of peace
with the English.</div>

<p>And againe, he was called into Italie to make warre against the king of Naples,
whose kingdome he pretended to apperteine to him by lawfull succession from his father
king Lewes, to whome Reine duke of Aniou last king of Sicill, of the house of
Aniou, had transferred his right to that kingdome (as partlie before ye haue heard)
wrongfullie and without cause disinheriting his coosine, godsonne and heire, Reine
duke of Loraine and Bar. The lord Chordes hauing commission from his maister the
French king to make some entrie into a treatie for peace with the king of England,
wrote letters to him before he passed ouer to Calis, signifieng to him that if it might
stand with his pleasure to send some of his councellors to the borders of the English
pale adioining to France, there should be so reasonable conditions of peace proffered,
that he doubted not but his grace might with great honour breake vp his campe, and
retire his armie home againe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commissioners
sent ouer to
Calis about the
said peace.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bullogne besieged
by the Englishmen
the king
himselfe present.</div>

<p>The king of England considering that Britaine was cl&eacute;erelie lost, and past recouerie,
and that Maximilian for lacke of monie, and mistrust which he had in his owne
subiects, laie still like a dormouse dooing nothing; and herewith weieng that it should
be honorable to him, and profitable to his people to determine this great warre without
bloudshed, appointed the bishop of Excester, and Giles lord Daubenie to passe the
seas to Calis, and so to commun with the lord Chordes of articles of peace, which
tooke effect as after ye shall perceiue. In the meane time, whilest the commissioners
were communing of peace on the marches of France, the king of England (as ye
haue heard) was arriued at Calis: from whense after all things were prepared for such a
iournie, he remooued in foure battells forward, till he came n&eacute;ere to the towne of Bullogne,
&amp; there pitched his tents before it in a conuenient place for his purpose, meaning
to assaile the towne with his whole force &amp; puissance.</p>

<p>But there was such a strong garison of warlike souldiers within that fortresse, and
such plentie of artillerie, and necessarie munitions of warre, that the losse of Englishmen
assaulting the towne (as was doubted) should be greater damage to the realme of
England, than the gaining thereof should be profit. Howbeit the dailie shot of the
kings battering p&eacute;eces brake the wals, and sore defaced them. But when euerie man
was readie to giue the assault, a sudden rumor rose in the armie that peace was concluded:
which brute as it was pleasant to the Frenchmen, so was it displesant to the
Englishmen, bicause they were prest and readie at all times to set on their enimies,
and brought into great hope to haue b&eacute;ene inriched by the spoile and game to haue
fallen to their lots of their enimies goods, beside the glorious fame of renowmed
victorie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why the English preferred warre before peace.</div>

<p>And therefore to be defrauded hereof by an vnprofitable peace, they were in great
fume, and verie angrie: and namelie, for that diuerse of the capteins to set themselues
and their bands the more gorgeouslie forward, had borrowed large summes of
monie, and for the repaiment had morgaged their lands and possessions, and some
happilie had made through sale thereof, trusting to recouer all againe by the gaines of
this iournie. Wherefore offended with this sudden conclusion of peace, they spake
euill, both of the king and his councell. But the king like a wise prince asswaged
their displeasure in part with excusing the matter, alledging what losse and bloudshed
was like to insue both of capteins and souldiers, if the assault should haue b&eacute;ene
giuen to the vtterance, especiallie sith the towne was so well furnished with men and
munitions. When he had somewhat appeased their minds with these and manie other
reasons, he returned backe againe to Calis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard Pl&#257;tagenet a counterfeit of ladie Margarets imagining.</div>

<p>There were not manie of the English armie lost at this siege of Bullogne, &amp; few or
no men of name, sauing that valiant capteine sir Iohn Sauage knight, the which,
as he and sir Iohn Riselie rode about the wals of the towne, to view in what place it
might be easiliest assaulted, was compassed about by certeine Frenchmen that were
issued out of the towne, and there slaine standing at defense and vtterlie refusing to
y&eacute;eld himselfe as prisoner. But sir Iohn Riselie escaped by flieng awaie. When the K.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
was thus returned to Calis, he began to smell a certeine secret smoke, which was like
to turne to a great flame, without wise foresight, and good looking to. For by the
craftie inuention, and diuelish imagination of the ladie Margaret duchesse of Burgognie,
a new idoll was set vp in Flanders, and by a forged name called Richard Plantagenet
second sonne to king Edward the fourth, as though he had b&eacute;ene raised from
death to life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conclusion of peace betw&eacute;ene the English and French.</div>

<p>The newes hereof somewhat troubled him, so that he was with better will content
to receiue the honorable conditions of peace offered of his enimie: bicause he should
not be constreined at one time to make warre both at home, and also in a forren
region. The conclusion of this agr&eacute;ement made with the Frenchmen, was this: That
this peace should continue both their liues; and that the French king should pay to
the king of England a certeine summe of monie in hand, according as the commissioners
should appoint for his charges susteined in this iournie. Which (as the king
certified the maior of London by his letters the ninth of Nouember) amounted to the
summe of seuen hundred fortie and fiue thousand duckats: the which is of sterling
monie, one hundred foure score and six thousand, two hundred and fiftie pounds. It
was also concluded that he should yearelie (for a certeine space) paie or cause to be
paid, for the monie that the K. had spent &amp; expended in the defense of the Britains
fiue &amp; twentie thousand crowns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alph&#333;se duke of Calabre made knight of the garter.</div>

<p>Which yearelie tribute the French king (afterwards continuallie occupied in the

taried a conuenient space at Calis, tooke the sea, and arriued at Douer, and so came
to his manour of Gr&eacute;enewich. Immediatlie after his returne thus into England, he
elected into the fellowship of saint George, commonlie called the order of the garter,
Alphonse duke of Calabre, sonne and heire to Ferdinando king of Naples, Christopher
Urswike the kings almoner was sent to him vnto Naples with the garter, collar, mantell,
and other habilments apperteining to the companions of that noble order. The which
was reuerentlie receiued of the said duke, who in a solemne presence reuested himselfe
with that habit, supposing by the countenance of that apparell to be able to
resist his aduersarie the French king, sith he was now made a fr&eacute;end and companion in
order with the king of England: but that little auailed him, as after it was right
apparant. [And here, bicause in sundrie actions we haue s&eacute;ene and obserued the
French kings subtilties, his inconstancie, lacke of truth, honestie, and kinglie modestie;
we maie be bold to set downe the description of his person, as we find the

were proportioned to his person.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French king described.</div>

<p>It is verie certeine (saith mine author) that king Charles from his infancie was of
complexion verie delicate and of bodie vnsound and diseased, of small stature, and of
face (if the aspect and dignitie of his eies had b&eacute;ene taken awaie) fowle and deformed,
his other members bearing such equall proportion, that he s&eacute;emed more a monster
than a man: he was not onelie without all knowledge of good sciences, but scarselie
he knew the distinct characters of letters: his mind desirous to command, but more
proper to anie other thing, for that being inuironed alwaies with his familiars and
fauourits, he reteined with them no maiestie or authoritie: he reiected all affaires and businesse,
and yet if he did debate and consider in anie, he shewed a weake discretion and
iudgement. And if he had any thing in him that caried apparance of merit or praise, yet
being thoroughlie weied and sounded, it was found further off from vertue than from vice:
he had an inclination to glorie, but it was tempered more with rashnesse and furie than
with moderation and counsell: his liberalities were without discretion, measure or
distinction: immooueable oftentimes in his purposes, but that was rather an ill grounded
obstinacie than constancie. And that which manie call bountie, deserued more
reasonablie in him the name of coldnesse &amp; slackenesse of spirit.]</p>

Elizabeth. But now to returne to the new found sonne of king Edward coniured by
mens policies from death to life: ye shall vnderstand that the duchesse of Burgognie
euer desiring to cast a scorpion in the bosome of king Henrie, not for anie displeasure
by him towards hir wrought or doone; but onelie bicause he was descended of the
house of Lancaster, being an enimie to hir line, began to spin a new web, like a
spider that dailie weaueth when his kall is torne: for after that the earle of Lincolne,
which was by hir set foorth, had missed the cushin, and lost both horsse and spurres,
she could not be quiet, vntill she had practised a new deuise to put king Henrie to
trouble. And as the diuell prouideth venemous sauce to corrupt stomachs, so for hir
purpose she espied a certeine yoong man of visage beautifull, of countenance demure,
and of wit craftie and subtill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perkin Warbecke the

<p>This youths name was Peter Warbecke, one for his faintnesse of stomach of the
Englishmen in derision, called Perkin Warbecke, according to the dutch phrase, which
change the name of Peter to Perkin, of yoonglings and little boies, which for want of
age, lacke of strength, and manlike courage, are not thought worthie of the name of a
man. This yoong man trauelling many countries, could speake English and diuerse
other languages; &amp; for his basenesse of birth and stocke, was almost vnknowne of all
men; and driuen to s&eacute;eke liuing from his childhood, was constreined to go and trauell
thorough manie countries. The duchesse glad to haue got so m&eacute;et an organ for the

<p>Besides that, she with such diligence instructed him both in the secrets and common

house of Yorke, that like a good scholer, not forgetting his lesson, he could tell all
that was taught him promptlie without anie stackering or staie in his words. And
besides that, he kept such a princelie countenance, and so counterfeit a maiestie roiall,
that all men in manner did firmelie bel&eacute;eue, that he was extracted of the noble house

thinking that the time serued well for the setting foorth of hir malicious indention,
sent this Perkin hir new inuented mawmet, first into Portingale, and so craftilie into
the countrie of Ireland; to the intent that he, being both wittie and wilie, might
inuegle the rude Irishmen (being at those daies more inclined to rebellion than to

whether by his shrewd wit, or the malicious exhortation of the sauage Irish gouernours,

<p>The French king aduertised hereof, then being in displeasure with king Henrie, sent
into Ireland for Perkin, to the intent to send him against king Henrie, which was
then inuading France (as y&eacute;e before haue heard.) Perkin thought himselfe aloft, now
that he was called to the familiaritie of kings, and therefore with all diligence sailed
into France, and comming to the kings presence, was of him roiallie receiued and
after a princelie fashion interteined, and had a gard to him assigned, whereof was
gouernour the lord Congreshall: and to him being at Paris, resorted sir George
Neuill bastard, sir Iohn Tailor, Rowland Robinson, and an hundred English rebels.
Now, after that a peace (as before is said) was concluded betwixt the French king, and

<p>But some haue said (which were there attending on him) that Perkin, fearing least

and fled from Paris by night. But whether the French king knew of his
departure or not, the truth is, that he being in maner in despaire, returned to his first
founder the ladie Margaret, of whome he was so welcomed to all outward appearance,
that it s&eacute;emed she could not haue reioised at anie earthlie thing more, than she did at
his presence, and (as she could well dissemble) she made semblance as though she had
neuer s&eacute;ene him before that time. Now as she had sore longed to know not once,
but diuerse times in open audience, and in solemne presence, she willed him to declare
and shew by what means he was preserued from death and destruction, and in what
countries he had wandered and sought fr&eacute;endship; and finallie, by what chance of

they being thereof certified, might be in a readinesse to helpe and succour him at his

The duches gladlie receiued this message, and after sh&eacute;e had heard their errand, sh&eacute;e

countenance, and maner of Richard duke of Yorke, that sir Robert Clifford bel&eacute;eued
verelie, that he was the second sonne of king Edward; and therefore wrote a letter
of credit into England to his complices: and to put them out of doubt, he affirmed

with competent bands of soldiers, to k&eacute;epe the sea coasts and hauens, to vnderstand
who came in and went out of the realme; doubting least some great conspiracie were in
brewing against him. He also sent into the low countries certeine persons, to learne

him and them, that the yoong man, being with the ladie Margaret, had falselie and
vntruelie vsurped the name of Richard duke of Yorke, which long before was murthered
with his brother Edward in the Tower of London, by the commandement of
their vncle king Richard, as manie men then liuing could testifie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sum of
D. Warrams
sp&eacute;ech to the

<p>The ambassadors comming to the court of Philip the archduke, were honorablie interteined
of him and of his councell, and willed to declare the effect of their message.
William Warram made to them an eloquent oration, and in the later end somewhat
inueihed against the ladie Margaret, not sparing to declare, how she now in
hir later age had brought foorth (within the space of a few yeares togither) two detestable
monsters, that is to saie, Lambert (of whom y&eacute;e heard before) and this
same Perkin Warbecke, and being conceiued of these two great babes, was not deliuered
of them in eight or nine moneths as nature requireth; but in one hundred and
eightie moneths, for both these at the lest were fift&eacute;ene y&eacute;ers of age, yer she would
be brought in bed of them, and shew them openlie; and when they were newlie crept
out of hir wombe, they were no infants but lustie yoonglings, and of age sufficient
to bid battell to kings. Although these tawnts angred the ladie Margaret to the hart,
yet Perkin was more vexed with the things declared in this oration, and especiallie bicause
his cloaked iuggling was brought to light.</p>

<p>The duches intending to cast hot sulphur into the new kindled fire, determined with
might and maine to arme and set forward prettie Perkin against the king of England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
When the ambassadors had doone their message, and that the archdukes councell had
long debated the matter; they made answer, that to haue the king of Englands loue,
the archduke and they would neither aid nor assist Perkin nor his complices in anie
cause or quarrell. Yet notwithstanding if the ladie Margaret, persisting in hir rooted
malice towards the king of England, would be to him aiding and helping, it was not
in their power to withstand it; for bicause in the lands assigned to hir for hir dower,
she might franklie and fr&eacute;elie order all things at hir will and pleasure, without contradiction
of anie other gouernour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 9.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Espials sent into Flanders from the king for a subtill policie.</div>

<p>After that the ambassadors were returned with this answer, the king streight sent
foorth certeine espials into Flanders, which should feigne themselues to haue fled to
the duke of Yorke; and thereby search out the whole intent of the conspiracie, and
after what sort they meant to proc&eacute;ed in the same. Others were sent also to intise
sir Robert Clifford and William Barleie, to returne into England, promising to them
pardon of all their offenses and high rewards for obeieng the kings request. They that
were sent, did so earnestlie and prudentlie applie their businesse, that they brought
all things to passe at their owne desires. For first they learned who were the ch&eacute;efe
conspirators, and after persuaded sir Robert Clifford to giue ouer that enterprise,
which had no grounded staie to rest vpon. Albeit William Barleie at the first would
not leaue off, but continued his begun attempt; till after two yeares, he repenting him
of his follie, &amp; hauing pardon granted him of the king, returned home into his natiue
countrie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conspiring fautors of the counterfeit duke of Yorke.</div>

<p>When the king had knowledge of the chiefe capteins of this conspiracie (by the
ouerture of his espials which were returned) he caused them to be apprehended, and
brought to London before his presence. Of the which the chiefe were Iohn Ratcliffe,
lord Fitz-Water, sir Simon Montford, sir Tho. Thwaits knights, William Daubenie,
Robert Ratclifte, Thomas Cressenor, and Thomas Astwood. Also certeine pr&eacute;ests &amp;
religious men, as sir William Richford doctor of diuinitie, and sir Thomas Poines,
both friers of saint Dominikes order, doctor William Sutton, sir William Worseleie
deane of Paules, Robert Laiborne, and sir Richard Lesleie. Other which were guiltie,
hearing that their fellowes were apprehended, fled and tooke sanctuarie. The other
that were taken were condemned, of the which sir Simon Montford, Robert Ratcliffe,
and William Daubenie were beheaded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Flem.</i></div>

<p>Some had their pardons, and the pr&eacute;ests also for their order sake; but yet few of
them liued long after. The lord Fitz-Water pardoned of life, was conueied to Calis,
and there laid in hold, &amp; after lost his head; bicause he went about to corrupt his
k&eacute;epers with rewards, that he might escape, intending (as was thought) to haue
gone to Perkin. [Thus by the policie and subtile deuise of the king, practised to the
point by his espials, the sinewes of this conspiracie was rent in sunder. So that the
malicious ladie Margaret was not a little swolne with indignation when she saw the
course of hir deuise (now that it had passed so far as that it was knowne to people on
this side and beyond the seas) stopped, and the confederacie (whereto she speciallie
trusted) dissolued. Yet notwithstanding, as women will not (to die for it) giue
ouer an enterprise, which of an enuious purpose they attempt; so she put hir irons
afresh into the fier to set hir hatred forward: whome a while we will leaue at worke,
and shew some doings betw&eacute;ene England and Flanders.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">English commodities banished out of Flanders.</div>

<p>King Henrie taking displeasure with the king of Romans, for that he kept not
touch in aiding him against the French king, and partlie displeased with the Flemings,
but speciallie with the ladie Margaret, for k&eacute;eping and setting forward Perkin Warbecke,
not onelie banished all Flemish wares and merchandizes out of his dominions,
but also restreined all English merchants from their repaire and traffike into anie of
the lands and territories of the king of Romans, or of the archduke Philip, sonne to
the same king of the Romans; causing the mart to be kept at Calis, of all English
merchandizes and commodities. Wherefore the said king and his sonne banished
out of their lands and seigniories all English clothes, yarne, tin, lead, and other commodities
of this realme. The restreint made by the king sore hindered the merchants
aduenturers; for they had no occupieng to beare their charges, and to support their
credit withall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A riot made vpon the Easterlings.</div>

<p>And that most gr&eacute;eued them, the Easterlings being at libertie, brought to the realme
such wares as they were woont, &amp; so serued their customers throughout the realme.
Wherevpon there insued a riot by the seruants of the mercers, haberdashers, &amp; clothworkers
in the citie of London, the tuesdaie before saint Edwards day. For they perceiuing
what hinderance grew to their maisters, in that they were not able so well to
k&eacute;epe them as before they had doone, assembled togither in purpose to reuenge their
malice on the Easterlings, &amp; so came to the Stilliard, &amp; began to rifle &amp; spoile such chambers
&amp; warehouses as they cold get into. So that the Easterlings had much adoo to
withstand them, &amp; k&eacute;epe them back out of their gates, which with helpe of carpenters,
smiths, and other that came to them by water out of Southwarke, they shored
&amp; so fortified, that the multitude of the seruants and prentises, being assembled, could
not preuaile.</p>

<p>At length came the maior with a number of men, defensiblie weaponed, to remooue
the force; at whose approch those riotous persons fled awaie like a flocke of sh&eacute;epe.
But diuerse of them were apprehended, and vpon inquirie made before the kings
commissioners, aboue foure score seruants &amp; apprentises were found to be conspired
togither, and sworne not to reueale it; of whome some of the chiefe beginners were
committed to the Tower, and there long continued. But in conclusion, bicause none
of their maisters, nor anie one housholder was found culpable, the king of his clemencie
pardoned their offense, and restored them to libertie. [For he thought it no
credit to his crowne to take vengeance of such sillie soules by seueritie of death, whom
in clemencie pardoning he might restore to a reformed life.]</p>

The king certified before of his comming, went streight to the Tower of London the
morow after the day of Epiphanie, &amp; there taried till such time as sir Robert Clifford
was there presented to his person. This was doone for a policie, that if sir Robert
accused anie of the nobilitie, they might be called thither without suspicion of anie

Henrie sent sir Robert Clifford ouer as an espie, or else he would not so soone haue receiued

was nothing so, for both was he in great danger after his begun attempt, and neuer

and obteined it; and therewith opened all the maner of the conspiracie, so far as
he knew, and who were aiders, fautors, and chiefe beginners of it; amongst whome he
accused sir William Stanleie, whome the king had made his chiefe chamberleine, and
one of his priuie councell. The king was sorie to heare this, and could not be induced
to bel&eacute;eue that there was so much vntruth in him, till by euident proofes it
was tried against him. Then the king caused him to be restreined from his libertie in
his owne chamber within the quadrat tower, and there appointed him by his priuie

knew certeinlie that the yoong man was the indubitate heire of king Edward the

he bare no hartie good will toward king Henrie as then. But what was the cause that
he had conceiued some inward grudge towards the king; or how it chanced that the
king had withdrawen his speciall fauor from him, manie haue doubted. Some ind&eacute;ed
haue gessed, that sir William Stanleie, for the seruice which he shewed at Bosworth
field thought that all the benefits which he receiued of the king to be farre vnder
that which he had deserued, in preseruing not onelie the kings life; but also in
obteining for him the victorie of his enimies, so that his aduersarie was slaine in

treasure of king Richard, which he onlie possessed at the battell of Bosworth; by
reason of which riches and great power of men, he set naught by the king his souereigne
lord and maister. The king hauing thus an hole in his coat, doubted first what
he should doo with him; for loth he was to lose the fauour of his brother the earle of
Derbie: and againe to pardon him, he feared least it should be an euill example to
other, that should go about to attempt the like offense. And so at length, seueritie
got the vpper hand, &amp; mercie was put backe, in so much that he was arreigned at
Westminster and adiudged to die, and (according to that iudgement) was brought

Also, the K. sent into Ireland (to purge out the euill &amp; wicked s&eacute;eds of rebellion

Perkin Warbecke) sir Henrie Deane, late abbat of Langtonie (whome he made chancellor

of Perkin, hearing that sir Edward Poinings was come with a power to persecute

that the maner of a multitude is not to consult, and sagelie to aduise with

would not set one foot out of his ship, vntill he saw all things sure. Yet he

<p>I thinke it is not vnknowne vnto you (most noble king and puissant prince) into
what ruine the stocke house, and familie of Edward the fourth, of that name king of
England, is now of late brought to and fallen in, either by Gods permission, or by
diuine punishment; whose indubitate sonne (if you know not alreadie) I am, and by
the power of almightie God, preserued aliue to this houre from the mightie hand of a
tyrant. For my father king Edward (when he died) appointed his brother Richard
duke of Glocester to be our gouernour, protector, and defendor; whome the more
that he loued &amp; studied to aduance and promote, the better he thought that he would
loue, fauour, and tender his children. But alas my vnfortunate chance I may say!
how hath his trust b&eacute;ene turned into treason, and his hope into hinderance, all men
know and I f&eacute;ele. Our vncle was not the tutor and preseruer of our stocke and linage,
but the confounder &amp; destroier of our bloud and progenie. For that tyrant, blinded
and glutted with the desire of ruling and souereigntie, commanded Edward my brother
&amp; me to be slaine and dispatched out of this mortall life. Wherevpon that person,
to whome the weightie and cruell charge was commited and giuen to oppresse and
destroie vs poore innocent infants, and giltlesse babes, the more that he abhorred this
heinous and butcherlie offense, the more he feared to commit it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perkin calleth

<p>And so wauering in mind and doubtfull what to doo, at the length willing in part to
stanch the bloudie thirst of the vnnaturall tyrant, and in part to absteine from so heinous &amp;
detestable homicide, he destroied my brother and preserued me; like the good pr&eacute;est
Ioiada, who saued little Ioas, when all the children of the bloud roiall were commanded
by Athalia the qu&eacute;ene to be slaine and vtterlie destroied. And further, to the intent
that my life might be in suertie, he appointed one to conueie me into some strange
countrie; where when I was furthest off, and had most n&eacute;ed of comfort he forsooke
me suddenlie (I thinke he was so appointed to doo) and left me desolate alone without
fr&eacute;end or knowlege of anie rel&eacute;efe or refuge. And so king Richard did obteine the
crowne as a preie misch&eacute;efouslie gotten by the dispatching awaie of my brother and
me. So that I thus escaping, by reason of my tender infancie, forgat almost my selfe,

not of power to helpe me with men and munitions of warre, as she would gladlie haue

that whatsoeuer he were, it should neuer repent of his comming to him.] Shortlie
after, hauing this Perkin with him in companie, he entered into England with a
puissant armie, and caused proclamation to be made, to spare all those that would
submit themselues vnto Richard duke of Yorke. Herewith they began the warre in
most cruell maner, with slaughter of men, burning of townes, spoiling of houses,
and committing of all other detestable enormities; so that all the countrie of
Northumberland was by them in maner wasted, and destroied. At length, when the
souldiers were laden with spoiles, and saciate with bloud, perceiuing that no succoures
came out of England vnto the new inuented duke, contrarie to that which he had
made them to bel&eacute;eue would come to passe; they determined to retire rather with
assured gaine, than to tarrie the vncertaine victorie of that counterfeit duke, and
so therevpon they withdrew backe into Scotland inriched with preies and

<div class="sidenote">The counterfeit

<p>It is said, that Perkin Warbecke, being returned into Scotland with the king of
Scots, vnder a cloked pretense should sore lament the great slaughter, spoile, and
damage, which had b&eacute;ene doone at this last roade made into England; and therefore
as one that bare a naturall loue toward his natiue countrie, besought the king of Scots,
that from thensefoorth, he would no more so deface his naturall relme, and destroie
his subiects with such terrible fire, flame and hauocke; as who should saie, he being
ouercome now with compassion, did bewaile the cruell destruction of his natural
countrie of England. But the Scotish K. told him, that he s&eacute;emed to take thought
for that which appeared to be none of his, sith that not so much as one gentleman
or yeoman (for ought he could s&eacute;e) would once shew themselues readie to aid him
in the warre begun for his cause, and in his name, within that realme which he
pretended so cl&eacute;erelie to apperteine to him.</p>

<p>The king of England being certified of this inuasion, prepared an armie with all
diligence to have resisted the Scots: but they were returned yer the English power
could assemble togither. Now when the king was truelie certified that the Scotish
king was returned home, he staied all the preparations made at that time to go
against him. But yet meaning to be reuenged of the wrongs doone to him by king
Iames and his people; he first called a parlement, and in that assemblie of thr&eacute;e
estates of the realme, he declared the cause of the instant warre, and how necessarie
it should be for the suertie and wealth of the realme of England to haue that warre,
pursued against those enimies that had begun it. To this motion all the nobilitie
wholie agr&eacute;ed. And to the maintenance of that warre, a subsidie was by whole
assent of the parlement fr&eacute;elie giuen and granted. Which paiment though it
was not great, yet manie of the common people sore grudged to pay the same,
as they that euer abhorre such taxes and exactions. At the same parlement were
diuerse acts and statutes made, necessarie &amp; expedient (as was thought) for the
publike weale of the realme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king of England and Scotl&#257;d prepare for mutuall warre.</div>

<p>In the meane season the king of Scots, perceiuing that the Englishmen would
shortlie go about to reuenge the injuries doone to them by him and his people,
assembled eftsoones a puissant armie, that he might either defend his realme against
the English power, attempting to inuade his countrie, or else afresh to enter into the
English borders. And thus these two mightie princes minded nothing more than the
one to indamage the other. But the king of England would not deferre one houre
by (his good will) till he were reuenged, and therefore prepared a mightie armie to
inuade Scotland, and ordeined for ch&eacute;efteine thereof the lord Daubeneie. But as this
armie was assembled, and that the lord Daubenie was forward on his iournie towards
Scotland, he was suddenlie staid and called backe againe, by reason of a new
commotion begun by the Cornishmen for the paiment of the subsidie which was
granted at the last parlement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A rebellion in

<div class="sidenote">The two capteins
in this commotion.</div>

<p>These vnrulie people the Cornishmen, inhabiting in a barren countrie and vnfruitfull,
at the first sore repined that they should be so gr&eacute;euouslie taxed, and burdened the
kings councell as the onelie cause of such polling and pilling: and so being in their
rage, menaced the ch&eacute;efe authors with death and present destruction. And thus
being in a rore, two persons of the affinitie, the one called Thomas Flammocke, a gentleman,
learned in the lawes of the realme; and the other Michael Ioseph, a smith,
men of stout stomachs and high courages, tooke vpon them to be capteins of this
seditious companie. They laid the fault and cause of this exaction vnto Iohn
Morton, archbishop of Canturburie, and to sir Reginald Braie; bicause they were
ch&eacute;efe of the kings councell. Such rewards haue they commonlie that be in great
authoritie with kings and princes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prouost of

<p>The capteins Flammocke and Ioseph exhorted the common people to put on
harnesse, and not to be afeard to follow them in that quarrell, promising not to hurt
anie creature, but onelie to s&eacute;e them punished that procured such exactions to be
laid on the people, without anie reasonable cause, as vnder the colour of a little
trouble with the Scots, which (sith they were withdrawne home) they tooke to be
well quieted and appeased. So these capteins bent on misch&eacute;efe, (were their outward
pretense neuer so finelie coloured) yet persuaded a great number of people to assemble
togither, and condescended to do as their capteins would agr&eacute;e and appoint. Then
these capteins praising much the hardines of the people, when all things were readie
for their infortunate iournie, set forward with their armie, and came to Taunton,
where they slue the prouost of Perin, which was one of the commissioners of the
subsidie, and from thence came to Welles, so intending to go to London, where the
king then soiourned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Howard

<p>When the king was aduertised of these dooings, he was somewhat astonied, and
not without cause; being thus troubled with the warre against the Scots, and this
ciuill commotion of his subiects at one instant. But first meaning to subdue his
rebellious subiects; and after to proc&eacute;ed against the Scots, as occasion should serue,
he reuoked the lord Daubenie which (as you haue heard) was going against the
Scots, and increased his armie with manie chosen and piked warriors. Also mistrusting
that the Scots might now (hauing such opportunitie) inuade the relme againe;
he appointed the lord Th. Howard erle of Surrie (which after the death of the lord
Dinham was made high treasuror of England) to gather a band of men in the
countie Palatine of Durham, that they with the aid of the inhabitants adioining,
and the borderers, might k&eacute;epe backe the Scots if they chanced to make anie inuasion.
The nobles of the realme hearing of the rebellion of the Cornishmen, came to London,
euerie man with as manie men of warre as they could put in a readinesse, to aid the
king if n&eacute;ed should be. In the which number were the earle of Essex, and the lord
Montioy, with diuerse other.</p>

ch&eacute;efe capteine to lead them against their naturall lord and king. From Welles they
went to Salisburie, and from thence to Winchester, and so to Kent, where they
hoped to haue had great aid, but they were deceiued in that their expectation. For the
erle of Kent, George lord of Aburgauenie, Iohn Brooke, lord Cobham, sir Edward Poinings,
sir Richard Gilford, sir Thomas Bourchier, Iohn Peche, William Scot, and a
great number of people, were not onelie prest and readie to defend the countrie,
to k&eacute;epe the people in due obedience, but bent to fight with such as would lift vp
sword, or other weapon against their souereigne lord: insomuch that the Kentishmen
would not once come n&eacute;ere the Cornishmen, to aid or assist them in anie maner
of wise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manie of the

<p>Which thing maruelouslie dismaid the hearts of the Cornishmen, when they saw
themselues thus deceiued of the succours which they most trusted vpon, so that
manie of them (fearing the euill chance that might happen) fled in the night from
their companie, and left them, in hope so to saue themselues. The capteines of the
rebels, perceiuing they could haue no helpe of the Kentishmen, putting their onelie hope
in their owne puissance, brought their people to Blacke heath, a foure miles distant
from London, and there in a plaine on the top of an hill, they ordered their battels,
either readie to fight with the king if he would assail them, or else assault the citie of
London: for they thought the king durst not have encountered with them in battell.
But they were deceiued: for the king although he had power inough about to haue fought
with them before their comming so n&eacute;ere to the citie; yet he thought it best to suffer
them to come forward, till he had them farre off from their natiue countrie, and then
to set vpon them being destitute of aid in some place of aduantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The citie of

<p>The citie was in a great feare at the first knowledge giuen, how the rebels were so
n&eacute;ere incamped to the citie, euerie man getting himselfe to harnesse, and placing themselues,
some at the gates, some on the walles, so that no part was vndefended.
But the king deliuered the citie of that feare: for after that he perceiued how the
Cornishmen were all daie readie to fight, and that on the hill; he sent straight Iohn
Earle of Oxenford, Henrie Bourchier, earle of Essex, Edmund de la Poole, earle of
Suffolke, sir Rise ap Thomas, and sir Humfreie Stanleie, noble warriors, with a great
companie of archers and horssemen, to enuiron the hill on the right side, and on the
left, to the intent that all bywaies being stopped and foreclosed, all hope of flight
should be taken from them. And incontinentlie he himselfe, being as well incouraged
with manlie stomachs as furnished with a populous armie and plentie of artillerie, set
forward out of the citie, and incamped himselfe in saint Georges field, where he on
the fridaie at night then lodged.</p>

<p>On the saturdaie in the morning, he sent the lord Daubeneie with a great companie
to set on them earlie in the morning, which first got the bridge at Dertford Strand, which
was manfullie defended by certeine archers of the rebels, whose arrows (as is reported)
were in length a full cloth yard. While the earles set on them on euerie side, the lord
Daubenie came into the field with his companie, and without long fighting, the Cornishmen
were ouercome; and first they tooke the lord Daubenie prisoner: but whether it were
for feare, or for hope of fauour, they let him go at libertie, without hurt or detriment.
There were slaine of the rebels which fought and resisted, aboue two thousand men
(as Edward Hall noteth) and taken prisoners an infinite number, &amp; amongst them the
blacke smith, and other the ch&eacute;efe capteins, which were shortlie after put to death.
When this battel was ended, the king wanted of all his numbers but thr&eacute;e hundred,
which were slaine at that conflict.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iames lord Audelie

<p>Some affirme, that the king appointed to haue fought with them not till the mondaie,

and in no arraie of battell; and so by that policie obteined the field and victorie. The
prisoners as well capteins as other, were pardoned, sauing the ch&eacute;efe capteins and
first beginners, to whome he shewed no mercie at all. The lord Audeleie was drawne
from Newgate to the Tower-hill in a coate of his own armes, painted vpon paper
reuersed and all torne, and there was beheaded the foure and twentith of Iune.
Thomas Flammocke &amp; Michael Ioseph were hanged, drawne, and quartered after the
maner of traitors, &amp; their heads and quarters were pitched vpon stakes, and set vp in
London, and in other places: although at the first, the king meant to haue sent
them into Cornewall, to haue b&eacute;ene set vp there for a terror to all others. But
hearing that the Cornishmen at home were readie to begin a new conspiracie, least he
should the more irritate and prouoke them by that displeasant sight, he changed his
purpose, for doubt to wrap himselfe in more trouble than n&eacute;eded.</p>

<p>While these things were adooing in England, the king of Scots being aduertised of the
whole matter and rebellion of the Cornishmen, thought not to let passe that occasion:
and therefore he eftsoones inuaded the frontiers of England, wasting the countrie,
burning townes, and murthering the people, spareing neither place nor person: and
while his light horsmen were riding to forraie and destroie the bishoprike of Durham,
and there burned all about, he with an other part of his armie did besiege the castell
of Norham. The bishop of Durham Richard Fox, being owner of that castell, had
well furnished it both with men and munitions aforehand, doubting least that would
follow which came now to passe. The bishop, after that the Scots made this inuasion,
aduertised the king (as then being at London) of all things that chanced in the
North parts; and sent in all post hast to the earle of Surrie, to come to the rescue.
The earle being then in Yorkeshire, and hauing gathered an armie, vpon knowledge
giuen to him from the bishop, with all diligence marched forward, and after him
followed other noble men out of all the quarters of the North, euerie of them bringing
as manie men as they could gather, for defense of their countrie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What lords &amp;

sir Thomas a Parre, sir Rafe Ellecker, sir Iohn Constable, sir Iohn Ratcliffe, sir Iohn

<div class="sidenote">The earle of

<p>When the Scots had diuerse waies assaulted and beaten the castell of Norham, but
could make no batterie to enter the same, they determined of their owne accord to
raise the siege, and returne; and that so much the sooner in verie d&eacute;ed, bicause they
heard that the earle of Surrie was within two daies iournie of them, with a great
puissance. Wherefore king Iames raised his siege, and returned home into his owne
realme. When the earle knew of the kings returne, he followed him with all hast
possible, trusting suerlie to ouertake him, and to giue him battell. When the earle
was entred Scotland, he ouerthrew and defaced the castell of Cawdestreimes, the
tower of Hetenhall, the tower of Edington, the tower of Fulden: and he sent Norreie
king at armes to the capteine of Haiton castell, which was one of the strongest places
betwixt Berwike and Edenburgh, to deliuer him the castell. Which he denied to doo,
affirming that he was sure of sp&eacute;edie succours.</p>

<p>The earle h&eacute;erevpon laid his ordinance to the castell, and continuallie beat it, from
two of the clocke till fiue at night, in such wise, that they within rendered vp
the place, their liues onelie saued. The earle caused his minors to raise &amp; ouerthrow
the fortresse to the plaine ground. The Scotish king was within a mile of the siege,
and both knew it, and saw the smoke, but would not set one foot forward to the
rescue. While the erle laie at Haiton, the king of Scots sent to him Machemont,
and an other herald, desiring him at his election, either to fight with whole puissance
against puissance, or else they two to fight person to person; requiring that if the
victorie fell to the Scotish king, that then the earle should deliuer for his ransome, the
towne of Berwike, with the fishgarths of the same.</p>

and not his, the which he neither ought nor would laie to pledge, without the king of
Englands assent; but he would gage his bodie, which was more pretious to him than
all the townes of the world, promising on his honour, that if he tooke the king prisoner

as was conuenient for the degr&eacute;e of an earle, and thanked him greatlie for the

vouchsafe to admit so poore an earle to fight with him bodie to bodie. When he had

fled in the night season with all his puissance. When the earle knew that the king
was reculed, and had b&eacute;ene in Scotland six or seuen daies, being dailie and nightlie
vexed with continuall wind and raine, vpon good and deliberate aduise returned backe
to the towne of Berwike, and there dissolued his armie, tarieng there himselfe, till he
might vnderstand further of the kings pleasure. In the meane time there came an

lesse learning than wit &amp; policie, to mooue and intret a peace betw&eacute;ene the two kings

<p>This Spanish ambassadour so earnestlie trauelled in his message vnto the king of
Scots, that at length he found him conformable to his purpose: and therefore wrote
to the king of England, that it would please him to send one of his nobilitie or councell,
to be associat with him in concluding of peace with the Scotish king. The king
of England was neuer dangerous to agr&eacute;e to anie reasonable peace, so it might stand
with his honour; and therefore appointed the bishop of Durham doctor Fox, to go
into Scotland about that treatie which Peter Hialas had begun. The bishop (according
to his commission) went honorablie into Scotland, where he and Peter Hialas at
the towne of Iedworth, after long arguing and debating of matters with the Scotish
commissioners, in st&eacute;ed of peace concluded a truce for certeine yeares; vpon condition,
that Iames king of Scots should conueie Perkin Warbecke out of his realme,

vanquished and subdued. Also the lord of Camphire, and other oratours of Philip
archduke of Austrich, and duke of Burgognie came to him for the conclusion of

request being verie agr&eacute;eable to the quietnesse and wealth of his realme, and especiallie
at that time, he did fauorablie grant and agr&eacute;e vnto. And so did the Englishmen
resort againe into the archdukes dominions, and were receiued into Antwerpe
with generall procession: so glad was that towne of their returne. Shortlie after the
concluding of the truce betw&eacute;ene England and Scotland, Perkin Warbecke being
willed of the king of Scots to depart out of the Scotish dominions, sailed with his

minding not to let passe so faire an occasion, hauing with him foure small ships, and

thr&eacute;e thousand persons, which immediatlie called him their capteine, promising to
take his part, and follow him to the death. Then Perkin well incouraged, made proclamations
in the name of king Richard the fourth, as sonne to king Edward the
fourth. And by the aduise of his thr&eacute;e councellors, Iohn Heron mercer a bankrupt,
Richard Skelton a tailor, and Iohn Astelie a scriuener determined first of all to assaie

<p>Then hasting thither, he laid siege to it, and wanting ordinance to make batterie,

heauing with iron barres, and kindling of fire vnder the gates, he omitted nothing
that could be deuised for the furtherance of his purpose. The citizens, perceiuing in
what danger they stood, first let certeine messengers downe by cords ouer the wall,
that might certifie the king of their necessitie &amp; trouble. And herewith taking vnto
them boldnenesse of courage, determined to repell fire with fire, and caused fagots to
be brought and laied to the inward parts of the gates, and set them all on fire; to the
intent that the fire being inflamed on both sides the gates, might as well k&eacute;epe out their
enimies from entring, as shut in the citizens from fl&eacute;eing out, and that they in the
meane season might make trenches and rampiers to defend their enimies in st&eacute;ed of

citizens, with helpe of such as were come foorth of the countrie adioining to their aid,
so valiantlie defended the walles, that they slue aboue two hundred of Perkins souldiers
at that assault. The king hauing aduertisement of this siege of Excester, hasted
foorth with his host, in as much sp&eacute;ed as was possible, and sent the lord Daubeneie

the valiant lord William his sonne, accompanied with sir Edmund Carew, sir Thomas
Trenchard, sir William Courtneie, sir Thomas Fulford, sir Iohn Halewell, sir Iohn
Croker, Water Courtnie, Peter Edgecombe, William saint Maure, with all sp&eacute;ed came
into the citie of Excester, and holpe the citizens, and at the last assault was the earle
hurt in the arme with an arrow, and so were manie of his companie, but verie few
slaine.</p>

<p>When Perkin saw that he could not win the citie of Excester, sith he sawe it was
so well fortified both with men and munitions, he departed from thence, and went
vnto Taunton, and there the twentith day of September he mustered his men; as
though he were readie to giue battell: but perceiuing his number to be minished, by
the secret withdrawing of sundrie companies from him, he began to put mistrust in
all the remnant. In d&eacute;ed when the people that followed him, in hope that no small
number of the nobilitie would ioine with him, saw no such matter come to passe, they
stale awaie from him by secret companies. When the king heard that he was gone to
Taunton, he followed after him with all sp&eacute;ed. And by the way there came to him
Edward duke of Buckingham, a yoong prince of great towardnesse; and him followed
a great companie of noble men, knights and esquiers, as sir Alexander Bainam, sir
Maurice Barkleie, sir Robert Tame, sir Iohn Guise, sir Robert Pointz, sir Henrie

<p>At the kings approching to the towne of Taunton, he set before him Robert lord
Brooke lord steward of his house, Giles lord Daubeneie his chiefe chamberleine, and
sir Rice ap Thomas. But as soone as Perkin was informed that his enimies were
readie to giue him battell, he that nothing lesse minded than to fight in open field with
the kings puissance, dissembled all the daie time with his companie, as though nothing
could make him afraid: and about midnight, accompanied with thr&eacute;e score horssemen,
he departed from Taunton in post to a sanctuarie towne beside Southampton,
called Beaudlie, &amp; there he and Iohn Heron with other registred themselues as persons
priuileged. When as king Henrie knew that Perkin was thus fled, he sent after him
the lord Daubeneie with fiue hundred horssemen toward the sea side, to apprehend
him before he should get away. Although Perkin escaped (as I haue said) vnto
sanctuarie, yet manie of his chiefe capteins were taken and presented to the king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The beautifull

<p>Also the horssemen that were sent, without anie stop or staie came to saint Michaels

and brought hir streight to the king. At whose beautie and amiable countenance the
king much maruelled, and thought hir a preie more m&eacute;et for a prince, than for the
meane souldiers, and sent hir incontinentlie vnto London to the qu&eacute;ene, accompanied
with a sort of sage matrones and gentlewomen, bicause she was but yoong. The
common people that had followed Perkin, after that their ch&eacute;efeteine was fled, threw
awaie their armour as people amazed, and submitted themselues to the king, humblie
bes&eacute;eching him of mercie, which he most gentlie granted, and receiued them to his
fauour. After this the king road to Excester, and there not onelie commended the
citizens, but also hartilie thanked them for dooing so well their duties in defending
their citie from their enimies. He also put there to execution diuerse Cornishmen,
which were the authors and principall beginners of this new conspiracie and insurrection.
Neuerthelesse, he vsed maruellous clemencie also in pardoning a great number

<p>&para; For when king Henrie was come to Excester with a great armie, mooued therevnto

fled before the kings comming, he staied a few daies about the examination of the said
rebellion, and the executing of the chiefe and principall capteins. In the end, the
multitude of the offendors being great, and most humblie crauiug for pardon, the
king caused them all to be assembled in the churchyard of saint Peters, where they
all appeared bare headed, in their shirts, and with halters about their necks. His
grace was then lodged in the treasurors house, lieng fast vpon the churchyard, and
out of a faire and large window (made for the purpose) he tooke the view of them,
who shouted and cried out for pardon. At length, when the king had paused, h&eacute;e
made a speach vnto them, exhorting them to obedience, and in hope he should thencefoorth
find them dutifull, he pardoned them all: whereat they all made a great shout,

seditious businesse. Wherefore he caused the sanctuarie wherein Perkin was inclosed,
to be inuironed with two bands of light horssemen, to watch diligentlie, that Perkin should
not escape by anie meanes foorth of that place vntaken: and withall attempted by
faire promises of pardon and forgiuenes, if Perkin would submit himselfe to him and
become his man. Perkin perceiuing himselfe so shut vp, that he could no waie escape,
of his owne fr&eacute;e will came out of the sanctuarie, and committed himselfe to the kings

And therefore he appointed Thomas lord Darcie, Amise Paulet knight, and Robert
Sherborne deane of Poules (that was after bishop of Chichester) to be commissioners
for assessing of their fines that were found culpable. These commissioners so bestirred
themselues, in tossing the coffers and substance of all the inhabitants of both those

and Islands of the same, as by his charts and other reasonable demonstrations he shewed,
caused the king to man and vittell a ship at Bristow, to search for an Iland which he
knew to be replenished with rich commodites. In the ship diuerse merchants of
London aduentured small stocks, and in the companie of this ship sailed also out

<p>In this yeare the warre had like to haue b&eacute;ene reuiued betwixt the realmes of

came arriued before Norham castell, &amp; beheld it woonderous circumspectlie, as though
they would faine haue b&eacute;ene of counsell to know what was doone therein. The
k&eacute;epers not perceiuing anie damage attempted against them for the first time, determined
not to mooue anie question to them, or once to stirre out. But when they came
againe the next day, and viewed it likewise, the k&eacute;epers of the castell suspecting
some euill meaning, demanded of them what their intent was, and why they viewed
and aduised so the castell. The Scots answered them roughlie with disdainfull words,
so that the Englishmen fell to and replied with strokes; and after manie blowes giuen
and receiued, diuerse Scots were wounded, and some slaine; and the residue ouermatched
with multitude of the Englishmen, fled as fast as their horsses could carie
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span></p>

<p>The Scotish king hereof aduertised, was highlie displeased, and in all hast signified
to king Henrie by his herald Marchemont, in what sort his people (to the breach of
the truce) were abused and handled. King Henrie being not in will to breake with
anie of his neighbours, excused the matter, affirming that he was not of knowledge
to the misdemeanor of those that had the castell in k&eacute;eping; requiring the king of
Scots not to thinke the truce broken for anie thing doone without his consent; promising
in the word of a king to inquire of the truth, and if the offense were found to
be begun on the partie of the k&eacute;epers of the castell, he assured him that they should
for no m&eacute;ed nor fauour escape due correction and punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of

<p>This answer (though it was more than reasonable) could not pacifie the king of

lamented, that by such as he appointed k&eacute;epers there, the warre should be renewed
with sundrie letters written to the Scotish king, at length asswaged his displeasure,
so that the said king wrote courteouslie to the bishop againe, signifieng that bicause
he had manie secret things in his mind, which he would communicate onelie with him
touching this matter now in variance; therefore he required him to take the paine to
come into his countrie, trusting that he should thinke his labor well bestowed. The

now he desired much more to haue confirmed, for further maintenance &amp; increase
thereof. Which he doubted not but should sort to a fortunate conclusion, if the king
of England would vouchsafe to giue to him in matrimonie his first begotten daughter
the ladie Margaret, vpon which point he purposed latelie to haue sent his ambassadors
into England, which thing he would the sooner doo if he knew the bishops mind
therein to b&eacute;e readie to further his sute. The bishop answered but few words sauing

order. The king liked well thereof as he to whome peace was euer a souereigne

to escape out of the Englishmens hands (which was the onelie thing that he most
desired) found meanes yet at length to deceiue his k&eacute;epers, &amp; took him to his h&eacute;els.
But when he came to the sea coasts, and could not passe, he was in a maruellous
perplexitie: for euerie by way, lane, and corner was laid for him, and such search
made, that being brought to his wits end, and cut short of his pretensed iournie, he
came to the house of Bethlem, called the priorie of Sh&eacute;ene beside Richmond in

which had in his k&eacute;eping the keies of the gate of S. Iohns within the same towne of
Turneie. Also I had an vncle called maister Iohn Stalin, dwelling in the parish of S.

<p>And after I was led by my moother to Antwerpe for to learne Flemish, in a house
of a cousine of mine, an officer of the said towne, called Iohn Stienbecke, with
whome I was the space of halfe a yeare. And after that I returned againe to Turneie,
by reason of warres that were in Flanders. And within a yeare following I was
sent with a merchant of the said towne of Turneie, named Berlo, to the mart
of Antwerpe, where I fell sicke, which sickenesse continued vpon me fiue moneths.
And the said Berlo set me to boord in a skinners house, that dwelled beside the house
of the English nation. And by him I was from thense caried to Barow mart; and I
lodged at the signe of the old man, where I abode for the space of two moneths.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perkin a notable

<p>After this, the said Berlo set me with a merchant of Middleborow to seruice for to

then was I put in seruice to a knight that dwelled in Lushborne, which was called

then I put my selfe in seruice with a Briton, called Pregent Meno, which brought me

<p>The scholer was hanged, on Shrouetuesdaie at saint Thomas Waterings, and the frier
condemned to perpetuall prison. For at that time so much reuerence was attributed
to the holie orders, that to a pr&eacute;est (although he had committed high treason against
his souereigne lord) his life was spared, in like case as to anie other offender in murther,
rape, or theft, that had receiued anie of the thr&eacute;e higher holie orders. [The
ch&eacute;efe cause (saith Edward Hall) of this fauour was this, bicause bishops of a long
time and season did not take knowledge, nor intermix themselues with the search &amp;
punishment of such heinous and detestable offenses: by reason whereof they did not
disgrade and depriue from the holie orders such malefactors and wicked persons,
which without that ceremonie by the canon lawes could not be put to death.</p>

so euer he had committed (treason onelie excepted) should likewise as affines &amp; alies
to the holie orders be saued, and committed to the bishops prison. And to the intent
that if they should escape, and be againe taken, committing like offense, that their liues
be no more to them pardoned: it was ordeined that murtherers should be burnt on the
brawne of the left hand with an hot iron signed with this letter M. and th&eacute;eues in
the same place with this letter T. So that if they, which were once signed with anie
of these markes or tokens did reiterate like crime &amp; offense againe, should suffer the
paines and punishments which they had both merited and deserued. Which decr&eacute;e was
enacted and established in a session of parlement kept in the time of this kings reigne,

<div class="sidenote">Katharine

K. of Spaine
affied to Arthur

<p>About this time died thr&eacute;e bishops in England, Iohn Morton archbishop of Canturburie,
Thomas Langton bishop of Winchester, and Thomas Rotheram archbishop of
Yorke. After him succ&eacute;eded Thomas Sauage bishop of London, a man of great
honour and worthinesse: in whose place succ&eacute;eded William Worham, of whome before
is made mention. And Henrie Deane bisbop of Salisburie, was made archbishop of
Canturburie, and Richard Fox was remooued from Durham to the s&eacute;e of Winchester.
Also this yeare two notable mariages were concluded, but not consummate till afterwards,
as you shall heare in place conuenient. For king Henrie granted his daughter
ladie Margaret to Iames the fourth king of Scots. And Ferdinando king of Spaine
gaue his daughter ladie Katharine to Arthur prince of Wales, sonne and heire apparant
to the king of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 17.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The fourth of
October as <i>Stow</i>
hath noted.</div>

<p>Among other articles of the mariage concluded with the Scotish king this was one,
that no English men should be receiued into Scotland without letters commendatorie
of their souereigne lord, or safe conduct of his warden of the marches; and the same
prohibition was in like maner giuen to the Scots. This yeare the ladie Katharine of
Spaine was sent by hir father king Ferdinando with a puissant nauie of ships into
England, where she arriued in the hauen of Plimmouth the second daie of October
then being saturdaie. Vpon the twelft of Nouember she was conueied from Lambeth
through London with all triumph and honour that might be deuised to the bishops
palace, the str&eacute;ets being hanged, and pageants erected after the maner as is vsed at a
coronation: which solemnitie Edward Hall describeth with the sumptuous shewes
then glistering in the beholders eies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Flem. ex. Edw. Hall. fol.</i> lij.</div>

<p>&para; I passe ouer (saith he) the wise deuises, the prudent sp&eacute;eches, the costlie
works, the cunning portratures, practised and set foorth in seuen goodlie beautifull
pageants, erected and set vp in diuerse places of the citie. I leaue also the goodlie
ballades, the sw&eacute;et harmonie, the musicall instruments, which sounded with heauenlie
noise on euerie side of the str&eacute;ets. I omit further, the costlie apparell both of goldsmiths
worke and imbroderie, the rich iewels, the massie chaines, the stirring
horsses, the beautifull bards and the glittering trappers, both with belles and spangels
of gold. I pretermit also the rich apparell of the princesse, the strange fashion of
the Spanish nation, the beautie of the English ladies, the goodlie demeanure of
the yoong damosels, the amorous countenance of the lustie bachelers. I passe ouer
also the fine ingrained clothes, the costlie furs of the citizens, standing on scaffolds,
raised from Gracechurch to Paules. What should I speake of the oderiferous scarlets,
the fine veluets, the pleasant furres, the massie chaines, which the maior of
London with the senat, sitting on horssebacke at the little conduit in Cheape, ware
on their bodies and about their necks? I will not speake of the rich arras, the costlie
tapestrie, the fine clothes both of gold and siluer, the curious veluets, the beautifull
sattens, nor the pleasant silkes which did hang in euerie str&eacute;et where she passed, the
wine that ran continuallie out of the conduits, and the graueling of the str&eacute;ets
n&eacute;edeth not to be remembred.</p>

<p>Whilest this ladie soiourned for hir recreation in the bishops palace of London,
being in the meane time visited of the king, the qu&eacute;ene, and the kings mother,
there was erected in the bodie of S. Paules church a long bridge made of timber, extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
from the west doore of the church to the step at the entring into the qu&eacute;ere,
which was six foot from the ground. On the said bridge or stage, euen directlie
before the consistorie of the church, was a place raised like a mount for eight persons
to stand vpon, compassed round about with steps to ascend and descend, which
was couered with fine red worsted, and in likewise were all the railes of the
said stage. On the north side of this mount was a place decked and trimmed for
the king and qu&eacute;ene, and such other as they appointed to haue. On the south side
of the same mount stood the maior and the magistrates of the citie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The solemnisation

<p>When all things were prepared and set in order, vpon the fouret&eacute;enth of Nouember
then being sundaie, the foresaid ladie was led to the said mount, and there
prince Arthur openlie espoused hir, both being clad in white, both lustie and amorous,
he of the age of fift&eacute;ene and more, and she of the age of eight&eacute;ene or thereabouts,
the king and qu&eacute;ene standing priuily on their stage. After the matrimonie
celebrated, the prince and his wife went vp into the qu&eacute;ere, and there heard a solemne
masse soong by the archbishop of Canturburie, associat with ninet&eacute;ene prelats mitred.
And after the masse finished, the bride was led homewards to the bishops palace by
the duke of Yorke, being then a goodlie yoong prince, and the legat of Spaine.
Next after followed the ladie Cicilie sister to the qu&eacute;ene, supporting the traine of
the spouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Edw. Hall fol.</i> liij.</div>

<p>But to speake of all the solemne pompe, noble companie of lords and ladies, and
what a sumptuous feast and plentifull was kept, with dansing and disguisings,
words might sooner faile than matter worthie of rehearsall. Howbeit euerie daie
endeth and night insueth, and so when night was come, the prince and his beautifull
bride were brought and ioined togither in one bed, where they laie as man and
wife all that night. &para; Now when the morning app&eacute;ered, the prince (as his familiar
seruitors, which had then neither cause nor reward to lie or fame, openlie told the
tale) called for drinke, which he before times was not accustomed to doo. At which
thing one of his chamberleins maruelling, asked the cause of his drouth. To whome
the prince answered merilie, saieng; I haue this night b&eacute;ene in the middest of
Spaine, which is a hot region, and that iournie maketh me so drie: and if thou
haddest b&eacute;ene vnder that hot climat, thou wouldest haue b&eacute;ene drier than I.</p>

<p>Shortlie after the king and the qu&eacute;ene, with the new wedded spouses went from

London in barges gorgeouslie trimmed gaue their attendance. And there in the
palace were such martiall feats, valiant iusts, vigorous turneis, and such fierce fight
at the barriers, as before that time was of no man had in remembrance. Of this
roiall triumph lord Edward duke of Buckingham was chiefe chalenger, and lord
Thomas Greie marquesse Dorset chiefe defender, which with their aids and companions
bare themselues so valiantlie, that they got great praise and honour, both of
the Spaniards, and of their owne countriemen. During the time of these iusts and
triumphs, were receiued into London, an earle, a bishop, and diuerse noble personages
sent from the king of Scots into England, for conclusion of the mariage betw&eacute;ene
the ladie Margaret and him; which earle by proxie, in the name of king
Iames his maister, affied and contracted the said ladie. Which affiance was published
at Paules crosse, the daie of the conuersion of saint Paule: in reioising

inhabitants in that part of London. Also the tower n&eacute;ere to the Blacke friers was
taken downe by the commandement of the maior. Also this yeare were brought

named in Anno 1498. These men were clothed in beasts skins, and eat raw flesh,
but spake such a language as no man could vnderstand them, of the which thr&eacute;e

<div class="sidenote">Edmund erle of

into Flanders.</div>

<p>A few moneths before the mariage of prince Arthur, Edmund de la Poole earle of
Suffolke, sonne to Iohn duke of Suffolke, and ladie Elizabeth sister to king Edward
the fourth, being bold and rash withall, was indicted of murther, for sleaing of a
meane person in his rage &amp; furie. And although the king pardoned him whome he
might iustlie haue put to death for that offense; yet bicause he was brought to the
barre before the kings Bench, and arraigned (which fact he tooke as a great blemish to
his honour) shortlie after vpon that displeasure he fled into Flanders vnto his aunt
the ladie Margaret, the king not being priuie to his going ouer. Neuerthelesse,
whether he was persuaded by his fr&eacute;ends therevnto, whom the king had willed to
deale with him therein; or whether vpon trust of his innocencie: true it is that he
returned againe, and excused himselfe to the king, so that he thought him to be giltlesse
of anie crime that might be obiected against him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The discontented
mind of the
earle of Suffolke.</div>

<p>But when the mariage betwixt the prince &amp; the ladie Katharine of Spaine was
kept at London, this erle either for that he had passed his compasse in excessiue
charges and sumptuousnesse at that great triumph and solemnitie, and by reason
thereof was farre run into debt; either else through the procurement of his aunt the
foresaid ladie Margaret; or pricked with some priuie enuie, which could not patientlie
with open eies behold king Henrie (being of the aduerse faction to his linage) so
long to reigne in wealth and felicitie: in conclusion with his brother Richard fled
againe into Flanders. This departure of the earle sore vexed the king, doubting, of
some new trouble to insue thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings
woonted policie
now againe
practised.</div>

<p>But yet to vnderstand the full meaning of the said earle, the king vsed his old
fetch: for immediatlie after the earle was fled, he appointed sir Robert Curson,
whome he had aduanced to the order of knighthood, and made capteine of Hammes
castell, a valiant man and a circumspect, to dissemble himselfe one of that conspiracie;
who went into Flanders, to espie what was doone there by the ladie Margaret,
and hir nephue the earle of Suffolke. After that the said sir Robert Curson
was thus gone into Flanders, the king, to put him out of all suspicion with the said
ladie Margaret and the earle, caused the said earle, and sir Robert Curson, and fiue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
persons more to be accurssed at Paules crosse, the first sundaie of Nouember, as enimies
to him and his realme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tirrell and Windham
beheaded.</div>

<p>To be br&eacute;efe, the king by his meanes, and other such diligent inquisition as he
made, tried out such as he suspected, partlie to be deuisers of misch&eacute;efe against
him, and partlie to beare no sincere affection towards his person, so that he could
readilie name them: whereof a great part were within few daies apprehended and
taken. And amongst them William lord Courtneie, sonne to the earle of Deuonshire,
which maried the ladie Katharine, daughter to king Edward the fourth; lord William
de la Poole, brother to the foresaid earle of Suffolke, sir Iames Tirrell, and sir Iohn
Windham. Both the Williams were rather taken of suspicion, bicause they were
so n&eacute;ere of kin to the conspirator, than for anie prooued matter. But sir Iames Tirrell
and Iohn Windham, bicause they were traitors, and so attainted, the sixt daie of Maie
after their apprehension, they were on the Tower hill beheaded.</p>

<p>When the earle of Suffolke heard what fortune thus happened to his fr&eacute;ends, as
one in vtter despaire to haue anie good successe in his pretensed enterprise, wandred
about all Germanie and France, to purchase some aid and succour, if by anie means
he might. But when he perceiued no stedfast ground to catch anchor hold vpon,
he submitted himselfe vnder the protection of Philip archduke of Austrich. But his
brother Richard, being a politike man, so wiselie ordered himselfe in this stormie
tempest, that he was not intrapped either with net or snare. The king not yet out
of all doubt of ciuill sedition, bicause a great number of euill disposed persons partakers
of this conspiracie, were fled into sundrie sanctuaries, deuised to haue all the
gates of sanctuaries and places priuileged shut and locked vp, so that none should
issue out from thence to perturbe and disquiet him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sanctuaries
restrained.</div>

<p>And for that intent he wrote vnto pope Alexander, desiring him by his authoritie
to adiudge all Englishmen, being fled to sanctuarie for the offense of treason as enimies
to the christian faith, interdicting and prohibiting the refuge and priuilege of
sanctuarie to all such, as once had enioied the libertie and protection of the same, and
after that fled out, and eftsoones returned againe. Which thing after that the pope
had granted, turned to the great quietnesse of the king and his realme. For manie
that had offended, for feare to fall into danger, returned to the due subiection of
their prince; and other that were yet fr&eacute;e from perill, durst not hazard themselues
so boldlie as they durst haue doone before, vpon hope of such starting holes.</p>

this ladie Katharine thought and feared such dolorous chance to come: for when she
had imbraced hir father, and taken hir leaue of hir noble and prudent mother, and
sailed towards England, she was continuallie so tossed and tumbled hither and thither

<div class="sidenote">Iust comendations
of Morton
archbishop of
Canturburie and
sir Reginald
Braie.</div>

<p>The eight&eacute;enth of Februarie, the king at his palace of Westminster created his onelie
sonne Henrie prince of Wales, earle of Chester, &amp;c: who afterward succ&eacute;eded his
father in possession of the regall crowne of this realme. Moreouer, this yeare also,
after the deceass of that noble qu&eacute;ene, for hir vertue commonlie called good qu&eacute;ene
Elizabeth, departed out of this world also sir Reginald Braie knight of the garter, a verie
father of his countrie, for his high wisedome and singular loue to justice well worthie
to beare that title. If anie thing had b&eacute;ene doone amisse contrarie to law and equitie,
he would after an humble sort plainelie blame the king, and giue him good aduertisement,
that he should not onelie reforme the same, but also be more circumspect in
anie any other the like case. Of the same vertue and faithfull plainnesse was Iohn Morton
archbishop of Canturburie, which died (as is shewed aboue) two yeares before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cassimire ambassadour
from
the emperour
Maximilian.</div>

<p>So these two persons were refrainers of the kings vnbrideled libertie; whereas the
common people (ignorant altogither of the truth in such matters) iudged and reported,
that the counsell of those two worthie personages corrupted the kings cleane
and immaculate conscience, contrarie to his princelie disposition and naturall inclination;
such is euer the errour of the common people. &para; About this time died Henrie
the archbishop of Canturburie, whose roome doctor William Warram bishop of London
supplied. And to the s&eacute;e of London William Barnes was appointed, and after his
death succ&eacute;eded one Richard Fitz Iames. This yeare also the lord Cassimire marquesse
of Brandenburgh, accompanied with an earle, a bishop, and a great number of gentlemen
well apparrelled, came in ambassage from the emperor Maximilian, and were
triumphantlie receiued into London, and lodged at Crosbies place.</p>

<p>Their message was for thr&eacute;e causes, one to comfort the king in his time of heauinesse
for the losse of his wife. The second for the renewing of amitie, and the old
league. The third (which was not apparant) was to mooue the king to marie the
emperours daughter, the ladie Margaret, duchesse Dowager of Sauoie. The two first
tooke effect: for the king vpon Passion sundaie road to Paules in great triumph,
the said marquesse riding on his left hand. And there the bishop made to the king
an excellent consolatorie oration concerning the death of the qu&eacute;ene. And there also
the king openlie sware to k&eacute;epe the new reuiued league and amitie during their two
liues. But the third request (whether the let was on the mans side, or on the womans)
neuer sorted to anie conclusion.</p>

<p>The ladie Margaret the kings daughter, affied (as y&eacute;e haue heard) to the king of

earle of Northumberland, as warden of the marches, was commanded to deliuer hir

she was conueied to Lamberton kirke in Scotland, where the king of Scots, with the
flower of all the nobles and gentlemen of Scotland, was readie to receiue hir: to
whome the earle of Northumberland (according to his commission) deliuered hir.
The said earle of Northumberland that daie, what for the riches of his coat being

of his Henchmen, and braue trappers of his horsse, beside foure hundred tall men

diuerse acts est&eacute;emed necessarie for the preseruation of the common-wealth were
established: and amongst other, it was enacted, that th&eacute;eues and murtherers duelie
conuicted by the law to die, and yet saued by their books, should be committed to

<p>But the king now drawing into age, and willing to fill his chest with abundance of

inrich himselfe, as thus. He considered that the Englishmen little regarded the k&eacute;eping
of penall lawes, and pecuniall statutes, deuised for the good preseruation of the

but had offended in some one or other of the same lawes. At the first, they

troubled manie a man, whereby they wan them great hatred, and the king

<p>&para; In this twentith yeare (saith one of Excester) the king (hauing some n&eacute;ed of
monie) was by his councell aduised (by way, of beneuolence) to leuie the same vpon
the whole realme, as well of the cleargie as of the laitie. And for the same, commissioners
were assigned accordinglie. For the cleargie, Richard Fox, sometime
bishop of Excester, but now of Winchester, a verie wise, graue, and trustie councellor,
was appointed chiefe commissioner, and had the chiefest dealing therein. He
at daies and times appointed, assembled the cleargie before him, and (according to
the trust committed vnto him) he persuaded them by all the meanes he could, to be
liberall contributors to the king, considering his present n&eacute;ed, and who (for their

<div class="sidenote">The cleargie of

and scarsitie: but both were of one mind, and deuised all the waies they could to
saue their pursses. The first being called, alledged that they were dailie at great
charges and expenses in k&eacute;eping of hospitalitie, in mainteining themselues, their
house and familie; besides extraordinaries which dailie did grow and increase vpon
them: and by that meanes they were but bare and poore, and praied that they might
be borne withall, and pardoned for that time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The wisdome

<p>The other sort alledged, that their liuings were but small and slender, and scarse

a hard and a poore life, and therefore (they hauing nothing) praied that they might
be excused. The bishop when he had heard them at full, and well considered thereof,
verie wittilie, and with a prettie dilemma answered them both, saieng to the first:
"It is true, you are at great charges, and are well bes&eacute;ene in your apparell, well
mounted vpon your faire palfreies, and haue your men waiting vpon you in good
order; your hospitalitie is good, and your dailie expenses are large, and you are for
the same well reported amongst your neighbours; all which are plaine demonstrations
of your wealth and abilitie, otherwise you would not be at such voluntarie charges.</p>

<p>"Now hauing store to spend in such order, there is no reason, but that to your

"Albeit your liuings be not of the best, yet good, sufficient, and able to mainteine
you in better estate than you doo imploie it; but it appeareth that you are frugall and
thriftie men; and what others doo voluntarilie spend in apparell, house, and familie,
you warilie doo k&eacute;epe, and haue it to lie by you; and therefore it is good reason that
of your store you should spare with a good will and contribute to your prince;

<div class="sidenote">Philip archduke

landeth in the

England.</div>

<p>In this verie season, and the yeare of our Lord 1506, Elizabeth qu&eacute;ene of Castile
died without issue male, by reason whereof the inheritance of Castile (bicause that
kingdome is not partible) descended to ladie Iane hir eldest daughter by king Ferdinando,
the which was maried to Philip archduke of Austrich. Wherefore the yeare
following, about the sixt day of Ianuarie, hauing a great nauie prepared, he intituled
now king of Castile, sailed out of Flanders with his wife towards Spaine; but by a
mightie tempest of wind and foule weather, the whole nauie was dispersed and sparkled
abroad in diuerse places on the coasts of England. The kings ship with two
other vessels were blowne by tempest on the west part of the realme, to the port of
Weimouth in Dorsetshire. The king being wearied with the tossing of the seas, as
one not accustomed thereto, contrarie to the mind of his councellors, came on land to
refresh himselfe.</p>

<p>When it was knowne that strange ships were arriued in that place, there came
thither a great number, as well of gentlemen as commons of the countrie, to beat
them backe if they prooued to be enimies. But when they perceiued that the king
of Spaine was there driuen on land by force of weather, sir Thomas Trenchard knight,
ch&eacute;efe of that companie, went with great humblenesse vnto him, and did what he
could to haue him to his house, being not farre off, and so to cause him to stay, till
such time as king Henrie might be certified of his arriuall; to whome with all sp&eacute;ed
he sent diuerse posts to aduertise him of king Philips landing. In this meane while
came people in from all sides, vpon knowlege of this strange princes comming. And
among other there came sir Iohn Carew, with a goodlie band of piked men. Which
sir Iohn and sir Thomas Trenchard intreated the king of Castile not to depart, vntil
such time as he had spoken with the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king of

honorablie.</div>

<p>The king of Castile excused him by necessitie of his weightie enterprise: but when
he perceiued that if he would proffer to go once aboord to his ships againe, he might
be letted, and was like so to b&eacute;e; h&eacute;e thought good rather to assent to their humble
request and to s&eacute;eme to gratifie them; than by denieng it to procure their euil willes,
and yet neuer the n&eacute;er of his purpose. When king Henrie was informed of his landing,
he was right glad therof, and wrote vnto sir Iohn Carew, and to sir Thomas
Trenchard, that they should interteine him in the most honorable sort they could
deuise, till he might come himselfe in person to welcome him. Beside this, he sent
the earle of Arundell with manie lords and knights to attend vpon him. Which
earle (according to the kings letters) receiued him with thr&eacute;e hundred horsses, all by
torchlight, to the great admiration of the strangers.</p>

<p>King Philip s&eacute;eing no remedie but that he must n&eacute;eds tarie, would no longer gaze
after king Henries comming, but tooke his iournie toward Windsore castell, where
the king laie: and fiue miles from Windsore the prince of Wales, accompanied with
fiue earles, and diuerse lords and knights, and other to the number of fiue hundred
persons gorgiouslie apparelled, receiued him after the most honorable fashion. And
within halfe a mile of Windsore, the king, accompanied with the duke of Buckingham,
and a great part of the nobilitie of this realme, welcomed him, &amp; so conueied
him to the castell of Windsore, where he was made companion of the noble order of

where manie notable feates of armes were prooued both of tilt, turnie, and barriers.
In the meane season the erle of Suffolke, perceiuing what hope was to be had in

that a crowne which hoong in the middle of the nether house (to garnish a branch to

<div class="sidenote">King Philip cast
by casualtie of
sea vpon the
coasts of England.</div>

<p>&para; King Philip was imbarked to saile out of Flanders into Spaine with a great armie
by sea; and to reduce his going to a more facilitie and safetie (for he feared least his
father in law by the aid of the French would hinder his passage) he practised the
Spanish subtilties, and agr&eacute;ed with him to leaue vnto him the managing and policie of
the most part of affaires, and that they shuld take in common the title of king of
Spaine, according to the example in the qu&eacute;enes time: and lastlie, that the revenues
and tributes should be diuided in an order certeine &amp; indifferent. By reason of which
accord, his father in law, notwithstanding he was not assured of the obseruation, sent
him into Flanders manie ships to furnish his voiage: with the which, hauing imbarked
his wife, and Ferdinand his second sonne, he tooke his course into Spaine with forward
winds, which, within two daies turning cleane contrarie, after his nauie had runne a
dangerous fortune, and made a wearie resistance against the furie of the sea, his ships
were cast vpon sundrie coasts of England and Britaine; his owne person with two or
thr&eacute;e ships being driuen with manifest perill vpon England into the hauen of Southampton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philip promiseth
to redeliuer to

<p>Whereof Henrie the seuenth then king of that nation being aduertised, sent to him
with sp&eacute;ed manie barons to doo him honour, and desire him to come to his court,
then at London: a request which Philip could not denie, the king of Englands demand
b&eacute;eing no lesse honourable, than his owne estate full of necessitie and nakednesse.
He remained in the court of England, vntill all his nauie was reassembled, and eftsoones
rigged, making in the meane while betw&eacute;ene them new capitulations: wherein
albeit Philip in all other things held himselfe vsed as a king, yet in this one thing
complained, that he was constreined as a prisoner, to consent to redeliuer to K. Henries
hands the duke of Suffolke, whom he held prisoner within the castell of Namur, and
whom the king of England desired much to haue in his power, for that he quarrelled
the title of the crowne, pretending the right of the kingdome to apperteine to
him: onelie the king of England assured Philip by the faith and word of a king, that
he would not put him to death. Which he did as iustlie performe, as he had honorablie
promised, k&eacute;eping him in prison so long as he liued, and afterwards was beheaded
vnder the reigne and commandement of his sonne.]</p>

<p>This yeare the king began to be diseased of a certeine infirmitie, which thrise
euerie yeare, but specially in the springtime sore vexed him. And bicause for the
most part the harme that chanceth to the prince, is parted with his subiects, the
sweating sicknesse, which (as ye haue heard in the first yeare of the king) first
afflicted the people of this realme, now assailed them againe; howbeit by the remedie
found at the beginning of it, nothing the like number died thereof now this second

equall to the pestilence insued, by the working of the maisters of the forfeitures, and
such informers as were appointed thereto. By whose meanes manie a rich &amp; wealthie
person by the extremitie of the lawes of the realme were condemned and brought to
great losse and hinderance.</p>

<p>A great part of which their vndooings proc&eacute;eded by the inconuenience of such
vnconscionable officers, as by the abuse of exigents outlawed those that neuer heard,
nor had knowledge of the sutes commensed against them, of which hard and sharpe
dealing (the harme that thereof insueth considered) if the occasion might be taken
awaie by some other more reasonable forme and order of law deuised, whereby the

grudged, meane men kicked, poore men lamented, preachers openlie at Poules crosse

<p>Sir Gilbert Talbot knight, and Richard Bere abbat of Glastenburie, and doctor
Robert Sherborne deane of Poules, were sent as ambassadors from the K. to Rome, to
declare to Pius the third of that name newlie elected pope in place of Alexander the sixt
deceased what ioy and gladnesse had entered the kings heart for his preferment. But
he taried not the comming of those ambassadors, for within a moneth after that he
was installed, he rendered his debt to nature, and so had short pleasure of his promotion
[not beguiling the hopes which the cardinals concerned of him at the time of his
creation, the six &amp; twentith day after his election, which was in short time to die.
This popes name was Francis Piccolomini cardinall of Sienna, in whom was no expectation
of long life, both for his extreame age, and present sickenesse: a cardinall sure
of vnspotted report, and for his other conditions not vnworthie that degr&eacute;e; who to
renew the memorie of Pius secundus his vncle, tooke vpon him the name of Pius the
third.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pag. 307.</i></div>

<p>He succ&eacute;eded Alexander the sixt, who went to supper in a vineyard n&eacute;ere the Vatican
to reioise in the delight &amp; plesure of the fresh aire, &amp; was suddenlie caried for
dead to the bishops palace; his sonne also communicating in the same accident, but
with better fortune. For the day folowing, which was the eightenth day of August,
the dead corps of the pope (according to custome) was borne into the church of saint
Peter, blacke, swolne, and most deformed; most manifest signes of poison. But
Valentinois, what by the vigour and strength of his youth, and readie helpe of strong
medicines and counterpoisons, had his life saued, remaining notwithstanding oppressed
with long and gr&eacute;euous sickenesse: it was assuredlie bel&eacute;eued that the accident proc&eacute;eded
of poison, the discourse whereof (according to common report) was in this
sort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A practice of
custome by
poison to an ill
purpose vsed.</div>

<p>The duke Valentinois, who was to be present at that supper, had determined to
poison Adrian cardinall of Cornette, reseruing that time and place to execute his
bloudie resolution: for it is most certeine that in his father and him were naturall
customes to vse poison, not onelie to be reuenged of their enimies, or to be assured
of suspicions; but also vpon a wicked couetousnesse, to despoile rich men of their
goods, whether they were cardinals or courtiers, although they had neuer doone them
wrong, as hapned to the cardinall saint Ange, who was verie rich. This maner of
rage they would vse also against their greatest friends &amp; familiars, and such as had
bin their most faithfull seruants, such as were the cardinals of Capua and Modeno:
a recompense vnworthie the merits of good men, and not disagr&eacute;eable to the
disposition of such a father and sonne, whereof the one made all things lawfull by
vile dispensation; and with the other nothing was dishonest wherein was opportunitie
to his purposes. The duke Valentinois sent before certeine flagons with wine infected
with poison, which he gaue to a seruant that knew nothing of the matter, commanding
that no person should touch them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The pope poisoned
with the
wine that his
owne son had
sent to poison
the cardinall of
Cornette.</div>

<p>A commandement preiudiciall to his maister, as the ignorance of the seruant was
the instrument in the euill that happened both to the father and son. Such is the
sufferance of God, who in the execution of his iudgments raiseth one murtherer to
kill another, &amp; breaketh the brands of the fire vpon the head of him that first kindled
it: for the pope comming by aduenture somewhat before supper, and ouercome with
the drought and immoderate heat of the time, called for drinke. And bicause his
owne prouision was not yet brought from the palace, he that had the infected wine in
charge, thinking it to be recommended to his k&eacute;eping for a wine most excellent,
gaue the pope to drinke of the same wine which Valentinois had sent; who arriuing
while his father was drinking drunke also of the same wine, being but iust that they
both should tast of the same cup which they had brued for the destruction of others.
All the towne of Rome ran with great gladnesse to saint Peters about the dead bodie
of the pope, their eies not satisfied to s&eacute;e ded and destroied a serpent, who with
his immoderate ambition and poisoned infidelitie, togither with all the horrible examples
of crueltie, luxurie, and monstruous couetousnesse, selling without distinction both
holie things and prophane things, had infected the whole world.</p>

<p>And yet was he accompanied with a most rare, &amp; almost perpetuall prosperitie
euen from his yoong age, to the end of his life; desiring alwaies great things, and
obtaining most often that he desired. An example of much importance, to confound
the arrogancie of those men, who presuming to know and s&eacute;e perfectlie with humane
eies the depth of Gods iudgements, doo assure, that what happeneth either good or
ill to mortall men, proc&eacute;edeth either of their merits or faults: as though we saw not
dailie manie good men vniustlie tormented, &amp; wicked persons aboue their diseruings
liue in ease and honour: wherein who makes an other interpretation, derogates the
iustice and power of God, the greatnesse of which being not to be conteined within
any scripts or tearms present, knoweth how well and largely to discerne in an other
time and place the iust from the vniust, and that with rewards and eternall punishments.
In the meane time he powreth out his vengeance vpon the imaginers of
misch&eacute;efe in this life; so prouiding, as that they are caught in their owne snares,
and ouertaken with such destruction as they had prepared for others, according to that
saieng of the Psalmist:</p>

standeth on the riuer Churne. "There haue b&eacute;ene thr&eacute;e parish churches, whereof

yet standeth, but it is no parish church. There be two poore almes women endued

<p>This man thus borne at Cicencester in Glocestershire, and made bishop of Durham,

Henrie the eight; in whose court he was so continuallie attendant, that he could
not steale anie time to attend the affaires of his bishoprike. But yet not altogither
carelesse (though not so much as he ought to haue b&eacute;ene) of the place and cause
from whence and for which he receiued so great reuenues, as came vnto his hands
from that s&eacute;e. He repaired the third part of Tine bridge next vnto the south, which
he might well doo; for he was accompted the richest subiect through the realme.
To whome (remaining then at the court) the king gaue in charge to write a booke of
the whole estate of the kingdome, bicause he was knowne to the king to be a man
of sufficiencie for the discharge thereof, which he did accordinglie.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the king commanded cardinall Woolseie to go to this bishop, and to
bring the booke awaie with him to deliuer to his maiestie. But s&eacute;e the mishap!
that a man in all other things so prouident, should now be so negligent: and at that
time most forget himselfe, when (as it after fell out) he had most n&eacute;ed to haue
remembred himselfe. For this bishop hauing written two bookes (the one to answer
the kings command, and the other intreating of his owne priuate affaires) did bind
them both after one sort in vellame, iust of one length, bredth, and thicknesse, and
in all points in such like proportion answering one another, as the one could not by

hauing the booke, went from the bishop, and after (in his studie by himselfe)

merie and smiling, especiallie in his communication, his eies graie, his t&eacute;eth
single, and haire thin, of wit in all things quicke and prompt, of a princelie stomach
and hautie courage. In great perils, doubtfull affaires, and matters of importance,
supernaturall and in maner diuine; for he ordered all his dooings aduisedlie and with
great deliberation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iustice mingled
with mercie.</div>

<p>Besides this, he was sober, moderate, honest, courteous, bountious, and so much
abhorring pride and arrogancie, that he was euer sharpe and quicke to them that were
noted with that fault. He was also an indifferent and vpright iusticer, by the which
one thing he allured to him the hearts of manie people, and yet to this seueritie of his
he ioined a certeine mercifull pitie, which he did extend to those that had offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
the penall lawes, and were put to their fines by his iustices. He did vse his rigour
onelie (as he said himselfe) to dant, bring low, and abate the high minds and stout
stomachs of the wealthie and wild people, nourished vp in seditious factions and ciuill
rebellions, rather than for the gr&eacute;edie desire of monie; although such as were scourged
with amerciaments cried out, and said it was rather for the respect of gaine, than
for anie politike prouision. Ind&eacute;ed he left his coffers well stuffed, for he was no wastfull
consumer of his riches by anie inordinat meanes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Out of the

church at London.</div>

<p>To conclude, he had asmuch in him of gifts both of bodie, mind and fortune, as
was possible for anie potentate or king to haue. His politike wisedome in gouernance
was singular, his wit alwaie quicke and readie, his reason pithie and substantiall, his
memorie fresh and holding, his experience notable, his counsels fortunate and taken
by wise deliberation, his sp&eacute;ech gratious in diuerse languages, his person (as before ye
haue heard) right comelie, his naturall complexion of the purest mixture, leagues and
confederations he had with all christian princes. His mightie power was dread euerie
where, not onelie within his realme but without. Also his people were to him in as
humble subjection as euer they were to king; his land manie a daie in peace and tranquillitie,
his prosperitie in battell against his enimies was maruellous, his dealing in
time of perils and dangers was cold and sober, with great hardinesse. If anie treason
were conspired against him, it came out wonderfullie. His buildings most goodlie, and
after the newest cast, all of pleasure.</p>

<p>And so this king liuing all his time in fortunes fauour, in high honour, wealth and
glorie, for his noble acts and prudent policies is woorthie to be registred in the booke
of fame, least time (the consumer of all worthie things) should blot out the memorie
of his name here in earth, whose soule we trust liueth in heauen, enioieng the fruition
of the godhead, &amp; those pleasures prepared for the faithfull. [In memorie of whome,
his manifold vertues, with the fortunate successe of his affaires, and the gratious
descent of his loines, as they procured a famous report in nations farre and n&eacute;ere; so
haue some at the contemplation of his princelinesse, and euerie waie crowned with
felicitie, made memorials of his magnificence; to the immortalitie of his high praise
and vnblemishable renowme: among whome (for the truth of the report iustifiable
by the contents of this historie) one commeth to mind, which may well serue for an
epitaph:</p>

<p>&para;The altar and sepulture of the same king Henrie the seuenth, wherein he now

<p>Thomas Scroope, otherwise surnamed Bradleie, descended of the noble familie of the
Scroops, professed sundrie kinds of religions, as that of the order of saint Benet, and
saint Dominike, and likewise he became a Carmelite, and last of all he fell to and
preached the gospell in haire and sackecloth, till he vnderstood himselfe to be in the
displeasure of Walden and other, that could not awaie with such singularitie in him
or other, sounding (as they tooke it) to the danger of bringing the doctrine of
the Romish church in misliking with the people; for then he withdrew himselfe to his
house againe, and there remained twentie yeares, leading an anchors life, but yet after
that time he came abroad, and was aduanced to be a bishop in Ireland, and went to
the Roades in ambassage, from whence, being returned, he went barefooted vp and

Iohn Alcocke bishop of Elie, changed a nunrie at Cambridge into a college
named Iesus college, about the y&eacute;ere of Christ 1496. The chiefe cause of suppressing

dissolute liues; Stephan Hawes a learned gentleman, and of such reputation, as he
was admitted to be one of the priuie chamber to king Henrie the seuenth; William
Bintr&eacute;e, so called of a towne in Norffolke where he was borne, by profession a Carmelite

this life in the yeare of our Lord 1500; Henrie Medwall chapleine to the said Morton;
Edmund Dudleie borne of noble parentage, studied the lawes of this land, and profited
highlie in knowledge of the same, he wrote a booke intituled Arbor rei public&aelig;, the tr&eacute;e

of the historie leadeth; Iohn Bokingham an excellent schooleman; William Blackeneie
